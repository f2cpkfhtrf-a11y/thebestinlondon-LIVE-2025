| **TypeScript/ESLint** | Default | No changes (no errors) | ✅ OK |

## 🔴 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Primary Issues Found:
1. **No Node version pinning** → Vercel used different Node version than local
2. **No vercel.json** → Build commands not optimized for CI
3. **Station pages had import errors** → Components `Header`, `Footer`, `VenueCard` didn't exist
4. **Git commits stuck** → Terminal quote parsing issues (from previous sessions)

### Why Builds Were Failing:
- Vercel deployed commit `f74fcdc` (42 min old) with broken station page imports
- New fixes in local files were NOT committed/pushed due to terminal issues
- Build error: `Module not found: Can't resolve '../../../components/Header'`

---

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Node Version Pinning
**File**: `.nvmrc`
```
20
```

**File**: `package.json` (added engines)
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0 <21.0.0",
    "npm": ">=9.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 2. Vercel Configuration
**File**: `vercel.json` (created)
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "npm ci && npm run build",
  "installCommand": "npm ci",
  "env": {
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY": "@next_public_google_places_key",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID": "@next_public_ga_measurement_id",
    "NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED": "1"
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Explicit framework detection
- ✅ Clean install with `npm ci` (faster, deterministic)
- ✅ Telemetry disabled for faster builds
- ✅ Env var documentation

### 3. Station Pages Fixed
**Files**: 
- `/pages/halal/near-stations/[stationSlug].js`
- `/pages/halal/near-stations/index.js`

**Changes**:
- ❌ Removed: `import Header from '../../../components/Header'` (didn't exist)
- ❌ Removed: `import Footer from '../../../components/Footer'` (didn't exist)
- ❌ Removed: `import VenueCard from '../../../components/VenueCard'` (didn't exist)
- ✅ Added: Inline navigation, breadcrumbs, footer components
- ✅ Added: Proper theme imports from `utils/theme.js`
- ✅ Added: FSABadge, BestOfLondonBadge imports (these DO exist)

### 4. Build Health Documentation
**File**: `build-health.md` (created)
- Node version requirements
- Build commands and process
- Common failure modes + fixes
- Emergency hotfix procedure
- Vercel CLI fallback method

### 5. Deployment Automation
**File**: `deploy-fix.sh` (created)
- Pre-flight checks (Node, files)
- Clean build process
- Deployment options (Git push vs Vercel CLI)

**File**: `git-commit-and-push.sh` (created)
- Simple one-command git workflow
- Avoids Terminal quote parsing issues

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### Path 1: GitHub → Vercel (Recommended)
1. ✅ Files fixed and ready to commit
2. 🔄 Running: `deploy-fix.sh` (tests build locally)
3. ⏳ Next: Run `git-commit-and-push.sh` 
4. ⏳ Then: Vercel auto-deploys in 2-3 minutes

**Commands**:
```bash
cd /Users/htanweer/Desktop/thebestinlondon
bash git-commit-and-push.sh
```

### Path 2: Vercel CLI (Fallback if Git issues persist)
```bash
cd /Users/htanweer/Desktop/thebestinlondon
vercel build
vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod
```

---

## 📝 FILES CHANGED

### Created:
- `.nvmrc` → Node 20
- `vercel.json` → CI config
- `build-health.md` → Build documentation
- `deploy-fix.sh` → Deployment script
- `git-commit-and-push.sh` → Simple commit script

### Modified:
- `package.json` → Added engines field
- `pages/halal/near-stations/[stationSlug].js` → Fixed imports
- `pages/halal/near-stations/index.js` → Fixed imports

### Verified Exist (no changes):
- `next.config.js` → Image domains OK
- `.env.local` → API keys present
- `utils/theme.js` → Theme structure OK
- `components/FSABadge.js` → Exists
- `components/BestOfLondonBadge.js` → Exists
- `utils/halalStations.js` → Exists
- `public/venues.json` → Exists

---

## ⏭️ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Now):
1. Wait for `deploy-fix.sh` to complete in Terminal
2. If build succeeds ✅:
   ```bash
   bash git-commit-and-push.sh
   ```
3. Monitor Vercel dashboard for new deployment

### After Deployment:
1. Test URLs:
   - https://thebestinlondon.co.uk/halal/near-stations
   - https://thebestinlondon.co.uk/halal/near-stations/oxford-circus
2. Verify:
   - ✅ Pages load without errors
   - ✅ Images render
   - ✅ Navigation works
   - ✅ No console errors

### If Still Failing:
Use Vercel CLI fallback:
```bash
cd /Users/htanweer/Desktop/thebestinlondon
npm run build  # Verify works locally
vercel build
vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod
```

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] Local build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Git commit/push succeeds
- [ ] Vercel deployment starts (new commit detected)
- [ ] Vercel build succeeds (green ✅)
- [ ] Production URL serves pages correctly
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Station pages accessible and functional

---

## 📊 EXPECTED TIMELINE

- **Local build test**: 3-5 min (running now)
- **Git commit/push**: 10 seconds
- **Vercel detection**: 30 seconds
- **Vercel build**: 2-4 minutes
- **Total**: ~8-10 minutes from now

---

## 🆘 MANUAL FALLBACK (if automation fails)

If the scripts don't work, run these commands manually:

```bash
cd /Users/htanweer/Desktop/thebestinlondon

# Stage files
git add .nvmrc
git add vercel.json
git add package.json
git add build-health.md
git add deploy-fix.sh
git add git-commit-and-push.sh
git add pages/halal/near-stations/

# Commit (simple message)
git commit -m "fix: CI config"

# Push
git push origin main
```

Then check: https://vercel.com/dashboard

**Status**: 🟡 In Progress (build test running)
**Confidence**: 🟢 HIGH (all components verified, dependencies exist)
**ETA**: ~10 minutes to live deployment
