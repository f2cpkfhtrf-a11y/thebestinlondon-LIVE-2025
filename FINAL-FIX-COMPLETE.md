## 🔧 Technical Details

**Root Cause:**
- `dietary_tags` is stored as an OBJECT in venues.json:
  ```json
  {
    "dietary_tags": {
      "halal": true,
      "vegan": false,
      "vegetarian": true,
      "gluten_free": false
    }
  }
  ```
- Multiple pages were calling `.includes()` (an array method) on this object
- JavaScript threw: `TypeError: dietary_tags.includes is not a function`

**Solution:**
- Changed to object property access: `dietary_tags?.halal === true`
- Applied fix across ALL pages that use dietary filtering
- Tested locally, committed, pushed

**Files That Were Fine:**
- All other pages don't use dietary filters
- No changes needed to those

**Status**: ✅ All fixes applied and pushed
**Deployment**: 🔄 Building now (commit 58ca622)
**ETA**: 90 seconds from now
**Action**: Test and confirm working!
