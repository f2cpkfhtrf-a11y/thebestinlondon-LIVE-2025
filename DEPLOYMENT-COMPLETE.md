4. Update any new tube stations

### Quarterly Tasks  
1. Audit Google API usage & costs
2. Review Lighthouse scores
3. Check sitemap indexing in Google Search Console
4. Update static pages if needed

### As-Needed
- Add new cuisine filters
- Expand to new London boroughs
- Add more venue categories (cafes, pubs, etc.)

---

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

### Current State (Launch)
- ✅ **458 venues** with verified data
- ✅ **100% photo coverage**
- ✅ **97% website coverage**
- ✅ **0 broken links**
- ✅ **XML sitemaps** submitted to search engines
- ✅ **Mobile-responsive** dark premium theme

## 🚨 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **FSA API:** Connection issues during build (only 0.2% coverage)
   - **Solution:** Re-run pipeline during off-peak hours
   - **Alternative:** Scrape FSA website directly
   
2. **Google API Rate Limits:** 150ms delay between calls
   - **Current:** Works for 458 venues (3 minutes)
   - **Scale:** May need API key upgrade for 1000+ venues

3. **Static Site Generation:** Data only updates at build time
   - **Solution:** Use ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) or set up scheduled rebuilds
