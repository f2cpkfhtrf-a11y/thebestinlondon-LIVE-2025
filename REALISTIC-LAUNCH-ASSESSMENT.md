## ⚠️ INCOMPLETE (REQUIRES ATTENTION)

### Missing Pages (9/52)
1. `/best-cafes-london` - ✅ Created (coming soon page)
2. `/best-coffee-shops-london` - ❌ Not created
3. `/best-bakeries-london` - ❌ Not created
4. `/best-brunch-london` - ❌ Not created
5. `/best-bars-london` - ❌ Not created
6. `/search` - ❌ Not created
7. `/about` - ❌ Not created
8. `/contact` - ❌ Not created
9. `/guides` - ❌ Not created

**Impact:** Medium. Site can launch without these if they're added to roadmap.

### Link Verification
- ❌ No automated crawler run yet
- ❌ Card click-through not verified on all pages
- ❌ Slug generation utility not confirmed working

**Impact:** High. This is blocking for "zero dead links" requirement.

### Theme Consistency Audit
- ✅ Homepage uses premium theme
- ✅ New halal page uses premium theme
- ⚠️ Older cuisine/area pages may use previous theme
- ❌ No `/admin/theme-audit` page created

**Impact:** Medium-High. Visual inconsistency affects brand perception.

## 🔴 BLOCKERS FOR FULL LAUNCH

### Critical Blockers
1. **Link verification system** - Must build crawler to test all internal links
2. **Slug generation** - Must verify venue detail pages work
3. **Theme audit** - Must ensure ALL pages use same design system

### Medium Priority
4. **Missing utility pages** - /search, /about, /contact needed before marketing
5. **Data population** - Real venue data for cafes/bars/bakeries

### Low Priority
6. **Coming soon pages** - Can launch without if marked clearly in nav
7. **Guides system** - Can be phase 2

## 📋 HONEST SELF-ASSESSMENT

**What We Built Well:**
- Premium visual design system
- Solid component library
- Good documentation
- Clean code structure
- SEO foundations

**What's Incomplete:**
- Missing 17% of planned pages
- No automated link verification (yet)
- Theme consistency across old pages uncertain
- Venue detail functionality untested

**Confidence Level:**
- **Soft Launch:** 90% ready
- **Full Launch:** 70% ready (needs more work)

---

## ✅ RECOMMENDATION

**Launch Scenario A (Soft Launch) with clear roadmap:**

1. Deploy existing 43 high-quality pages NOW
2. Add "Coming Soon" badges to nav for missing sections
3. Build remaining pages over next week
4. Run full link audit as Phase 1.5
5. Marketing launch after Phase 1.5 complete

**Rationale:** Better to launch clean and focused than rush and have issues.

---

**Status:** AWAITING FOUNDER DECISION on launch scope

**Next Step:** Confirm which scenario, then execute systematically.
