## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails?
**Check these:**
- ✅ API key is set in Vercel environment variables
- ✅ All dependencies in package.json
- ✅ No syntax errors in code

**Common fixes:**
```bash
# Test build locally first:
npm run build

# If it works locally, it should work on Vercel
```

### Sitemap Not Working?
- Visit: `https://your-site.com/api/sitemap.xml`
- Should see XML with all restaurant URLs
- If 404: Check that `pages/api/sitemap.xml.js` exists

### Images Not Loading?
- Check that domains are allowed in `next.config.js`
- Verify API key is working

### Pages 404?
- Make sure all files are pushed to GitHub
- Check Vercel build logs
- Verify file structure matches local
