## üöÄ EXECUTION PLAN

### Step 1: Wait for Expansion Pipeline
**Status:** Running in Cursor
**Expected:** 200-300 new venues, improved East London coverage

### Step 2: Run Area Pages Updater
```bash
cd /Users/htanweer/Desktop/thebestinlondon
node scripts/update-area-pages.js
```

**This Will:**
- Update 7 East London area pages
- Add dietary filters to all
- Apply premium theme
- Backup old files (.bak)

### Step 3: Add Areas Section to Home Page
**Manual step** (requires code insertion)

**Location:** `/pages/index.js` after line ~850 (after Cuisines section, before Footer)

**Code to add:** See `/home/claude/areas_section_addition.txt`

OR I can write the full updated index.js file for you.

### Step 4: Verify Theme Consistency
All pages will now have:
- ‚úÖ Same color palette (#0B0B0B bg, #D4AF37 accent)
- ‚úÖ Same fonts (Playfair Display + Inter)
- ‚úÖ Same hover effects and animations
- ‚úÖ Same card styles
- ‚úÖ Same navigation pattern

## üéØ CUISINE ROUTING (ALREADY HANDLED)

The data expansion includes proper cuisine inference:

**In `/scripts/merge-expansion.js`:**
```javascript
function inferCuisines(place) {
  const cuisineMap = {
    'indian': ['indian', 'curry', 'tandoor', 'biryani'],
    'italian': ['italian', 'pizza', 'pasta'],
    'japanese': ['japanese', 'sushi', 'ramen'],
    // ... etc
  };
  // Matches keywords in name, types, description
}
```

**Result:**
- New venues automatically tagged with correct cuisines
- Will appear on `/indian-restaurants-london`, `/italian-restaurants-london`, etc.
- Dynamic pages already pull from `venues.json` via cuisines array

---

## üìä DIETARY TAGS (ALREADY HANDLED)

**In `/scripts/merge-expansion.js`:**
```javascript
function inferDietaryTags(place) {
  return {
    halal: text.includes('halal'),
    vegan: text.includes('vegan'),
    vegetarian: text.includes('vegetarian'),
    gluten_free: text.includes('gluten free')
  };
}
```

**Result:**
- Halal venues ‚Üí `/best-halal-restaurants-london`
- Vegan venues ‚Üí `/vegan-restaurants-london`
- Vegetarian venues ‚Üí `/vegetarian-restaurants-london`
- All filter tabs on home page will work

---

## üñºÔ∏è HIGH-RES IMAGES

**Strategy:**
1. **Google Places Photos** (primary)
   - Already in venues.json
   - `photos[0].url` contains Google photo URL

2. **Unsplash Fallbacks** (if no Google photo)
   - High-quality stock photos
   - 800x600+ resolution
   - Themed by cuisine/area

**Implemented in:**
- Home page venue cards
- East London hub page
- All area pages
- Cuisine pages (existing)

**Next.js Image Optimization:**
Already configured in `next.config.js`:
```javascript
images: {
  domains: [
    'maps.googleapis.com',
    'images.unsplash.com',
    'res.cloudinary.com'
  ]
}
```
