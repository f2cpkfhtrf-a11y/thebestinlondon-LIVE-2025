The staff were so welcoming and knowledgeable, which made us feel truly taken care of.\n\nWe chose the full set menu with wine pairing, and every dish was incredible. As a French person, I can be a bit critical when it comes to food (we French take it very seriously ðŸ˜‰), but here everything was simply perfect. One highlight for me was an artichoke dish by Chef Pascal, with just one bite, it brought me straight back to a childhood memory. Itâ€™s truly amazing when a chef can create food that evokes such deep emotions!\n\nWe were also very grateful to the Chef and his team for taking the time to show us around the kitchen and share a moment with us. It made the evening feel even more special and memorable.\n\nI had the most wonderful birthday celebration here, and itâ€™s an experience Iâ€™ll always remember. Thank you so much to the whole team!",

The food is of superb quality, and although not every dish in their 6 or 8 courses menu will please everyone, the quality of the food and the creativity of the pairings makes it an enriching dining experience.\n\nThe service is very kind and attentive. I would recommend the wine pairing as it paired beautifully with the food, and was very tasty.\n\nThe restaurant more than deserves its Michelin star, and in my opinion is a must-visit for anyone looking for a calm fine dining experience in London. The setting of the restaurant is also fantastic around Smithfield Market, on the northern boundary of the City of London, a stoneâ€™s throw away from Farringdon Elizabeth Line station entrance.",

The restaurant was empty but the food was amazing.\n\nHad a phenomenal tasting menu and by the end, my date and I were on the floor, we could not eat anymore, we were extremely well fed. They really catered to my dateâ€™s gluten free diet as well so he was not missing out on anything.\n\nThe only annoying thing for me was the person serving us wouldnâ€™t leave us alone to talk on our date, she proceeded to tell my date her entire life story which I found rather odd. They need to leave people alone to have their conversations and not tell them their entire life story, highly inappropriate especially as I was on a first date.\n\nHowever the food was incredible and they really catered to my dateâ€™s gluten free requirements so we were both very happy.",

When I told the sommelier that I was not drinking and asked for any non-alcoholic options, she replied \"coke\". I was shocked and speechless at the moment. It never occurred to me that I'd be drinking coke for a French meal. I didn't give up asking, so she said she could ask the bar to make a virgin Mojito but didn't know how much they would charge me... ummmm... she then \"guessed\" between Â£10-Â£15. I was really thinking if I should leave the restaurant as the conversation was getting weirder. Anyway, I stayed for the tasting menu. Virgin Mojito was a disaster, too sour and lots of crushed ice, herbs not fragrant at all. There was not enough front-of-house staff so food was always waiting on the tray to get served. For example, foam on dessert almost disappeared and turned to liquid when delivered. There were 9 tables on a Monday evening, so wasn't too busy to be excused.",
