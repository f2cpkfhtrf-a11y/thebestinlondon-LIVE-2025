The sausage added a nice contrast, juicy and slightly spicy. Everything came with thoughtful sides: pickles, chili slices, and that signature house BBQ sauce that ties it all together.\n\nThe charred greens with feta, pomegranate, and nuts were a great fresh counterpoint to the meat platter, and the fries with aioli disappeared instantly. Drinks were excellent too — the house lemonade with chili and lime was surprisingly refreshing and unique.\n\nService was friendly and efficient, the vibe industrial rustic and warm, and the food came out perfectly timed for sharing.\n\nIf you’re visiting with a small group and want to taste a bit of everything, go for the shared meat platter — it’s spot-on in both portion and variety.\n\n📍 SMOKESTAK, Shoreditch\n🔥 Perfect for: small groups, casual dinners, meat lovers, and anyone craving authentic slow-smoked BBQ in London.",

Portions are generous and the prices match the quality. It’s a busy place, so booking ahead is wise if you don’t want to gamble on a last-minute table. We ended up outside since that’s all that was left, but with perfect weather it turned into a highlight rather than a drawback.",

From the moment we were greeted on the door by Kitty and Cristian, the rapport and bonhomie was already a dead cert: Charming, cheerful and a little cheeky in all the right quantities, we were promised VIP treatment from the get go, and boy did we get it. The equally charming Alexandra took our order, but sat opposite the pass, even the chefs engaged us in a deeply convivial manner, only ever enabled by an open kitchen like this.\n\nAttentive, affable, and amusing, the team put on the perfect display of service with a smile, with a dash of well placed humour to really make us feel like part of the furniture or family….. not sure which.\n\nGo here, eat well, and enjoy the experience created by an exceedingly well-matched team who love their jobs (I hope)!",

We got a starter, 2 mains and one dessert 🍮 and a sorbet 🏠 super full for 2 people.\n\nDefinitely the sticky toffee pudding stood out the most. Good combo and not greasy. Warm dessert on a cool day. Otherwise beef brisket, beef ribs (super soft) and oxtail are all recs from us.\nGreat thanks to David again very observative, when the starter came he realised we were waiting so he asked if we preferred all dishes to come together, and also when the bottles were empty he bought a new one without us saying or asking 💓. Super lovely and made us feel very welcomed. Definitely a revisit soon.",
