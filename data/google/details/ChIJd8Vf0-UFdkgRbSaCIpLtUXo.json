Today, however, I had the pleasure of dining here for lunch for the very first time – and it was truly incredible!!\n\nWe started with three dishes,  the beef tartare, scallops and tuna. Each one was full of flavour, beautifully presented, and cooked to absolute perfection. I couldn’t fault a single thing.\n\nFor the main course, we had the famous lobster pie, which I can honestly say is worth every penny. It was rich, perfectly balanced, and the lobster itself was tender and succulent. Not something you come across or get to enjoy every day, I would highly recommend it to anyone dining here.\n\nWe finished with two desserts , the pear tart and the caramel creation (I forget the exact name of it) both of which were delicate yet packed full of flavour. They looked like works of art on the plate and tasted every bit as good as they appeared.\n\nBeyond the food, the staff deserve special mention. In all of my visits, they have consistently been accommodating, helpful, and very knowledgeable about everything on the menu. They’re always smiling and genuinely make you feel welcome – a real credit to the restaurant!\n\nWithout doubt, this is easily one of the best places to eat in Mayfair! I",

Carefully prepared, the blend of the flavors was simply mmmmm\nMust point out  the beef wellington.

From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel incredibly welcome – their warmth, attentiveness, and professionalism really stood out and added so much to the visit.\n\nThe food was absolutely exceptional – every dish was beautifully presented and full of rich, fresh flavours that exceeded my expectations.\n\nWhat made the visit even more special was the private tour I had of the restaurant's impressive artwork collection and private dining spaces. The art pieces are stunning and thoughtfully curated, adding a unique charm to the venue.\n\nOverall, Mount Street Restaurant offers not only outstanding food but also an unforgettable atmosphere, thanks to its amazing staff and beautiful surroundings.
