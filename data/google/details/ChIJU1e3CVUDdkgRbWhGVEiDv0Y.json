I’ve been getting used to eating Asian cuisine, so some flavors don’t surprise me the way they did when I first started exploring food tasting. Brigadiers, however, did the trick. Every dish was extremely flavorful and well-balanced. You could distinguish each ingredient, and none overpowered the other. That applied to everything we ordered.\n\nThe service was excellent too: fast even on a packed night. Our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable, and thanks to her recommendations, we were able to make better pairings that elevated the whole experience.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, it’s a sports bar, which gave it a lively vibe, yet it still managed to feel cozy and intimate. Very versatile energy overall. The décor was also a nice surprise. I especially loved the hallway leading to the bathrooms.",

What really steals the show is the food. Absolutely delicious. You order their grilled meats or potatoes or even a humble daal and they season it with magical umami that results in a lip smacking, satisfying experience. Butter chicken wings are a tad overhyped- the flavors are lovely but it’s too rich on butter. The Achari paneer is amazing. Service is very good despite how busy they are. I highly recommend Brigadiers for a remarkable gastronomic experience.",

The beef was so spicy it wasn’t enjoyable at all..\n\nThe guinea fowl kebabs - these specific kebabs must have been 90% salt because we couldn’t taste anything else - each bite felt like a spoon full of salt - horrible.\n\nThe goat shoulder curry - goat has a taste I know this but this goat tasted proper nasty, very strong foul goat taste I though I was gonna throw up at the table we took one bite each and left it.\n\nThe bread was ok.\n\nExtremely disappointed overall the chef was very heavy handed with the spices - not worth the money at all.",

      "text": "21st June 2025\n\nBrigadiers shouldn’t be this good. One of nine “independent” restaurants - including BAO, Bleecker Burger and Homeslice; did they think we just wouldn’t notice? - among the units either side of a walkway bisecting Bloomberg’s billion-pound, two-building European headquarters smack in the middle of the City, each demarcated by homogeneous management consultancy beige-on-black signage, it offers commercial bookings for up to 200 people and private rooms complete with flat screens and Sky Sports. As much as a place can be “inspired by the army mess rooms of India”, you can’t really imagine the military regiments over there wearing chinos and light blue Charles Tyrwhitt shirts, lining their stomachs with self-pour espresso martinis from the tap and £9 popadoms while they watch the Club World Cup.\n\nMercifully, we went on a Saturday, and it was actually quite nice. We sat on the terrace, on the Bloomberg Arcade itself, which though not exactly charming, was quiet, and points vaguely west, meaning on the clear and balmy summer evening that it was, as the waiters were in no hurry to move us along, we saw the sky move slowly through the full first third of the colour spectrum as we perused the menu and chatted and ordered and drank and ate and chatted and ordered some more.\n\nFirst up were the achari chicken skins, Afghani lamb and lasooni chicken skewers, and the Indo-Chinese paneer lettuce cups. I’m a sucker for anything “Indo-Chinese”, its appearance on a menu implying a kind of confident alchemic ability in the chefs through tireless trial and error in the kitchens of ancient multicultural kitchens to combine uncomplimentary ingredients into a coherent and delicious end product utterly unreplicable in my own ethnically homogeneous household. That’s would be a bit of a stretch here - the paneer had just been splashed with a bit of soy, but very skillfully and tastily - and so despite the high quality of the skewered meat and their thoughtful marinades and dipping sauces the chicken skins, crunchy vehicles for dollops of spiced minced glory, were my favourite.\n\nIn case you’ve not worked it out by now, Brigadiers is not your local curryhouse. In fact, there weren’t any curries on the menu at all - not a korma, jalfrezi or vindaloo in sight. Instead, after much deliberation, we got an aubergine biryani, tandoori lamb chops and wood-fired kid goat shoulder, as well as a dal markhani and naans between us. I don’t think any of them quite hit the same heights as the starters - although the silky, cumined, gingery goat came closest - but I’d have been happy with any of them as my own individual main. It all just felt like really high-quality cooking of high-quality ingredients in not overly complicated or complex but time-honoured and well-honed flavours , and the fact we were able to graze across all of them over a couple of hours - as well as the extremely decent cocktails too - made for a very pleasant evening indeed.",
