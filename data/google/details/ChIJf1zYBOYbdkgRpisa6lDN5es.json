It’s definitively British food with Thai influence, not vice versa - very original and creative. Don’t think there was a bad dish here, I’d definitely recommend to NOT skip the supplement as that was one of the best bites. The curry as well as the oysters and sausage starter were additional standouts. I was literally cleaning off the plate with their homemade brioche. Even the cucumber broth amuse bouche was delectable. Only two dishes that didn’t wow me were the Thai tea dessert and the side of greens that was very very salty. Other than that this restaurant is exactly the type of cooking I’d love to see more of in London. Unfussy interior and service, very friendly and felt cozy but not rugged. Will definitely be returning!",

It may have been the best octopus I have ever had. The Thai spices were unique and fantastic across all the courses. They also had excellent ice cream in both of the dessert courses. The ambiance could be a bit more elevated, as it was quite tightly packed but the food makes it more than worth the visit!",

Appetizer beetroot was a pleasant surprise for me too as I usually hated beetroot. But it didn't taste like it. Will be coming back! Riesling that our sommelier pick was really nice too. Unfussed vibe despite the michelin star, some dishes can be spicy for English taste but it didn't bother us",
