The design carves the restaurant into distinctive areas.\nThe menu is divided into breads, starters and mains over a separate menu for dessert.\nThe food was good but the desserts didn't live up to the expectations. The Caviar Soft serve was basically an ice cream with caviar! Not every culinary idea works.",

Feels like a bit of an odd time to stop service, especially on a weekend. The later menu just has a few more things, but a lot is the same.\n\nThey were clearly understaffed—staff were lovely and doing their best, but there just weren’t enough of them. We had to chase for pretty much everything (getting menus, ordering, paying).\n\nOn the plus side, the courtyard is such a nice place to sit on a warm day, and the food was genuinely tasty. I had the French toast and really liked it—soft and delicious.\n\nI’d definitely go back, but I hope they get a bit more help on busy mornings!",
