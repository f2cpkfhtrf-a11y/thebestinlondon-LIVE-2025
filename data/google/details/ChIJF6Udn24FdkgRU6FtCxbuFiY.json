The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars was the snack selection was pretty poor.

If you are finding a bar with a bit of uniqueness, good vibes and of course with some good pictures, this is the place. The interior is really unique and well thought out, it felt really welcoming as well.\n\nI had an mocktail and my friend had a rum cocktail, both drinks taste really good. I would like to try more next time!!! Just a note you will have to ask for mocktail since they aren’t on the menu.",

We stumbled upon this place while searching for lively bars in the area and were lucky enough to be offered a table around 10 PM without a reservation—a win in itself.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, the vibe was fun, quirky, and full of energy. The theme of the bar is super creative, and the atmosphere was electric with great music and even better cocktails.\n\nA huge shoutout to Cass, our server, who was absolutely phenomenal—genuinely friendly, attentive, and made our visit that much more memorable. He really embodied the welcoming spirit of the entire staff.\n\nWe loved it so much that we actually came back the next evening after checking out a few other spots in Soho that didn’t quite measure up. Not only did the staff remember us, but we were lucky enough to have Cass serve us again, which made us feel like regulars.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIf you’re looking for a fun, vibrant bar with excellent service, creative cocktails, and an unforgettable atmosphere, look no further than The Little Scarlet Door. This spot is officially on our list of must-visit places in London—and we can’t wait to return!",

I never felt like I was having to catch her attention- she just knew when to come along and ask if we needed anything. 10/10 service and interior and drinks were exceptional. I will be returning and trying the rest of the other branches.\n\nThank you Erin again for making our little evening special even though we forgot it was actually a graduation celebration lol!!",

I’ve been to fantastic bars and tried incredible cocktails but Peter made the “An Affair to Remember” for me and it’s the best cocktail I’ve had in my life.\nTrust me, try it, my friend is a gin fan and I’m a dark spirits fan but she loved it… it’s so balanced and smooth 😍\n\nWe went impromptu around 10pm - Great vibe in there, places to sit upstairs and downstairs but also space to dance which I love! The shower cubicle is such a chic touch.\n\nP.S. Shoutout to the sweet man at the cloakroom for picking up my mirror - we love chivalry.",
