It’s addictive. I’ve come back every day since my first one. Their mille-feuille? Unreal. The filling is creamy, custardy perfection- honestly, if I had a bucket and spoon, I’d live off it. Everything here just feels so decadent. The coffee is smooth and silky too — none of that bitter aftertaste you get at the big chains. And the staff are genuinely lovely — one of them even took the time to tell me how they make the croissants, which made me appreciate it even more. The place itself is adorable, cozy, and aesthetic — and being right across from work is dangerously convenient.",

      "text": "We lived in Hammersmith several years ago and then the place was our favourite- not a day without their fab baguette, not a weekend without their amazing desserts (you would enjoy each and every from the menu!) A magnificent taste of real France on the bank of River Thames it was then! Then we moved and only rarely I had a chance to pop in and buy as much as I could to enjoy these treats as long as possible!.. But my two recent visits really shocked me: not a baguette, not a single piece of dessert or tart was the same as before!?! That’s how I discovered what I actually started to suspect: the new owner. Thus - a totally new place, taste and aftertaste…\nNow I know why I don’t have to take this long trip to this once a gem of Hammersmith: a very average quality of every dessert, a very poor quality of pastries (croissant shouldn’t be called that name here anymore…) and bread (brioche is anything but a brioche here now…)\nI agree with other reviews, that new owners were too bold to keep the same price level for their products, but the worse thing is, that they also are trying to cut down their expenses by using lower quality (or quantity) of the ingredients.\nBut more importantly, I agree with the statement , that you can’t use the history of this place as your own, you have to clearly tell customers, that you are new there and just TRYING to keep this place as good as it once was…\nAdieu, Patisserie Saint Anna\n\nUPDATE. Received a response from the owner today: “Fake review”,. Sorry, guys, but this one is not fake. As a proof, adding a photo of my yesterday dessert (couldn’t finish it, sorry…). Use to love it so much, but now it has lots of lumps in it, so no pleasure of eating that at all…",
