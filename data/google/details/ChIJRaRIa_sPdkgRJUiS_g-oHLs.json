The interior has a warm, inviting charm that instantly makes you feel relaxed, and the atmosphere strikes a perfect balance between buzzing and cozy. What stood out just as much was the team, genuinely friendly, always smiling, and attentive without being overbearing. That kind of service goes a long way.\n\nFood and drinks came out quickly, which was impressive given how busy it was. I was tempted to order the whole menu (seriously, everything looked amazing), but I went with the Turkish eggs, and they were absolutely excellent. Rich, flavorful, and satisfying enough to carry me through the day.\n\nAll in all, Eggbreak delivered on every level, great vibe, kind service, and food that truly hits the spot. I’ll definitely be back, and maybe next time, I will try everything on the menu",

Unfortunately, my experience was disappointing.\n\nFood:\nI tried the Egg, Bacon & Cheese Toastie, it looked great but tasted very average, nothing special.\n\nI also ordered Ari’s Pancakes, but couldn’t finish them as the bananas were not fresh, which was off-putting.\n\nI ordered a pot of tea as well, but the tea strainer provided was clearly not clean (as shown in my photos), which was another let-down.\n\nService & Atmosphere:\nThe place was very busy, and while that reflects its popularity, the staff seemed rushed and a bit erratic. Service felt inattentive overall.\n\nOverall:\nGiven all the hype, I expected much better food and service. There are far better breakfast places in London, and I don’t think I’ll be returning to Eggbreak. It would also be hard for me to recommend it to others.",
