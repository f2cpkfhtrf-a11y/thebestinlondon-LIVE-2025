And we were surprised with the free dessert to greet us for our special day, and they were also able to accommodate our request regarding the seating arrangement. Thank you to all the staffs!

When we got to the restaurant our table was ready despite us being 10-15 minutes early, we were taken to our table and we had booked the skyline experience so was seated next to the window with a great view. The meal we had was amazing and the portion sizes were very fair, not too small and not too much. The duck was the best thing as they bring it out and cut it in front of your table for you to see. We was here celebrating a birthday and the staff even prepared a little happy birthday treat for my partner which was ever so kind. Well worth the money and I would come back here for sure",

However, it would have been helpful to know there’s a cut-off 30 minutes before your booking ends, which did take away from the experience. I also found a staff comment about ordering more food a bit unnecessary — if I want more, that’s my choice and what I’m paying for. The food was just okay, nothing special, and the view felt quite far away (would have been better by a window). Overall, some highlights but not sure it’s worth the money.",
