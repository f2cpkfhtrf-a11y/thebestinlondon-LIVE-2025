Excellent food & bar service and very grateful for the little extra mile they went on countless details of hosting a wedding party night for 90 approx people.\nThey provided ample amount of the amenities needed, kept me updated throughout a smooth running night. Fantastic staff and service. Thanks team!",

The service was good, the staff is nice and the space is spacious. I do think that it might be also a good venue for celebrations or events. There was a live DJ playing and he really nailed it. Although it is a bit loudy, I really liked the place and you can still find a place to chill and hear each other somewhere upstairs. Recommended!",

We did a group set menu and the food was spectacular, so delicious and very generous servings with wonderful fresh, rich flavours. They kindly catered to dietary requirements and the service was impeccable - they really took care of us and we were all super impressed. They accommodated us moving to an outdoor table given it was such a beautiful balmy June evening and it was truly magical to relax and connect. Would absolutely recommend it for any corporate or personal event - it was an amazing venue.\n\nAlong with cocktails, the group set menu was absolutely spectacular starting with burrata and peppers, salmon fennel citrus salad, trout and crème fraiche, flatbreads both plain and topped with olive and tomato, and crispy chickpea hummus. Next came shared mains - delicious hispy cabbage on ratatouille, basil pesto baked orzo with rocket and Parmesan, and a baby chicken with gravy and greens. And of course we squeezed in the mountain of crispy churros with chocolate pots because dessert obviously goes into another tube.\n\nI was truly blown away by the fresh flavour-packed dishes, perfect location, and wonderful service. I’m still dreaming of that heavenly trout dip…",
