      "text": "Note that this review is specifically for the Taco Tuesday bottomless tacos. I thought the quality of the meats was perfectly fine - the beef was tender and fatty, and the chicken was not dry and had a satisfying crunch. However for a Korean fusion restaurant, these tacos severely lacked any Korean influence. The only element that tasted remotely Korean was the small pot of ssamjang sauce served alongside the tacos. They could‚Äôve done much more with the flavouring to really emphasise that this was Korean fusion cuisine.\n\nI did like the slaw though - it was crunchy, slightly bitter, and complemented the tacos well. On the other hand, we were perplexed by the aubergine and mushroom filling. The menu listed fried cauliflower, which would‚Äôve made a bit more sense, since a crunchy fried filling would‚Äôve been a nice contrast to the soft flour taco. This filling however, felt completely out of place and didn‚Äôt belong in a taco. It was too soft and saucy, the flavours leaned more Mediterranean than Korean, and it didn‚Äôt hold up well in a soft flour tortilla - it would‚Äôve been better served over rice. If not fried cauliflower, fried enoki mushrooms would‚Äôve worked well too?\n\nService was good, but nothing exceptional. It wasn‚Äôt really an issue to ask for more rounds after finishing the tray.\n\nI think with some adjustments, this deal could be worth going for.",

There was a great choice on the menu, everything was so tasty. The fried chicken was so crispy and delicious. I also really loved the cheesey peppers, it wasn't too spicy and still had loads of flavour, and the wedge salad was (surprisingly) my favourite dish!! Id recommend getting 4-5 dishes between 2, we also got 2 corn dogs and I think that was too much. Reasonable prices for the portion and quality. The staff were also really friendly and helpful, they made a mistake with one of our dishes but we're very quick to rectify it, id definitely recommend a visit here!",

Our experience was tainted by the unexpected service charge.\n\nWe did the tasting menu that had a lot of food but most of it tasted mediocre. The best thing was the kimchi stone pot stew and the slaw that comes with the tacos. Everything else - fried chicken, bacon mochi, cheese stuffed peppers, al pastor chicken, ice cream - all tasted pretty mediocre. The amount of mayo on fried chicken overwhelms anything else; the al pastor chicken tastes only of sweetness and it was served cold, not hot; the ice cream was super boring. Flavors were not on point, every dish felt like it was missing something. I wanted to like this restaurant in the name of Korean fusion food but unfortunately it missed the mark completely.\n\nWe paid at the end and after paying realized they had added a 12.5% service charge for our table of 2 persons. This was not mentioned when seated or ordering. So, on top of the mediocre food, this unexpected charge soured our experience. I doubt we‚Äôll return.",
