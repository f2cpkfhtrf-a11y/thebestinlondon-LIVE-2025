I specifically asked for spicy spicy and not British spicy (no offence intended here) for my takeaway order and they delivered beautifully. This place is run by a warm, friendly family. Good service, good food! I had the curry with rice and absolutely loved it! The other flavours aren't buried underneath all the heat from the chilies. Well balanced, would definitely recommend this place. The ambience looks good so hope to dine at the restaurant some day :)",

What a fantastic evening! Every dish we sampled boasted its own distinct and memorable flavor profile, a refreshing change from many unpleasant Thai restaurants out there.\n\nThe Crispy Golden Bags were a highlight—perfectly prepared and delightfully grease-free. The Chicken Satay was equally impressive, offering a wonderful smoky curry flavor and incredibly tender chicken.\n\nWe were also pleasantly surprised by the steamed sea bass fillet with ginger and the tamarind Silken tofu, both exceeding our initial expectations with their delicate yet impactful tastes.\n\nBeyond the exquisite food, the overall experience was truly exceptional. The service was natural and perfectly attentive, never feeling intrusive. It was clear the staff were genuinely happy and eager to please, which added significantly to the welcoming atmosphere.\n\nAs a gluten-intolerant diner, I particularly appreciated Phakoon Thai's excellent accommodation. It's a huge relief to find a restaurant that caters so thoughtfully to dietary needs without compromising on flavor or experience.\n\nWell done, Phakoon Thai, and thank you for a truly delightful evening!",

Portions were quite decent as I was quite full after the rice and curry. I think it would have been better to make a reservation as they turned down a couple people with no reservations despite the restaurant being semi empty (there were definitely quite a few tables available). We got given a table on the basis we vacated within an hour and a half which was plenty of time. Overall, staff were nice, food was good and came out quite fast and pricing was decent as well.",

I came here with one of my friends on a friend dinner date and I would highly recommend. We ordered the vegetarian starter platter and it was a good mix of foods for us to try. We then both got the pad Thai, I had chicken and she had tofu. The chicken does also come with tofu however I will say the tofu came with additional vegetables which I was envious of after trying the vegetable tempura which was 10/10. We then both had mango desserts and the only thing I found weird was my sticky rice was warm when it came out which I had never had before it was still delicious just means it was fresh. The mango was amazingly sweet which was also true for the mango sorbet/icecream. I will be visiting here again.",
