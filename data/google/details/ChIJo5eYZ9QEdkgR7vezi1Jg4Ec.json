      "text": "We recently visited this restaurant and had such an incredible experience from start to finish! The atmosphere was warm, lively, and welcoming, perfect for enjoying a hearty Korean meal. We also had an amazing server SJ, who served the three of us and was attentive the whole time.\n\nRecommendation Dishes:\nJajangmyeon with beef, Kimchi pancakes, tteokbokki with cheese, beef bimbibap.\n\nFor any Muslims coming here, there's plenty of halal dishes and you can substitute the pork with alternatives like beef, seafood or chicken.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious. The tteokbokki had just the right amount of spice and sweetness, with chewy rice cakes that were cooked perfectly. The kimchi pancake was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, packed with flavour and easily one of the best we’ve tried. The jajangmyeon with beef was rich and savoury, with a delicious flavour that paired so well with the noodles. The sides from the kitchen were also fantastic, everything from the kimchi to the pickled radish and other small dishes tasted fresh, well-seasoned, and perfectly complemented the mains. You can really tell that care and attention go into every dish.\n\nWe also tried the miso soup, which had a gentle umami flavour and a great palate cleanser between dishes. Personally, I found it a little mild for my taste, but my friends really enjoyed it, describing it as wonderfully soothing and comforting. It's like the kind of warm soup you’d crave when you’re feeling under the weather.\n\nWe ordered a few other dishes too, including the japchae, bibimbap, and mandu. The japchae had a good texture, the glass noodles were slightly bouncy but it wasn’t as flavourful as the other dishes we tried, so it felt a little dry and underwhelming in comparison. The bibimbap was enjoyable and nicely presented, though since we ordered quite a variety, it was naturally a bit overshadowed by the stronger flavours of the tteokbokki and jajangmyeon. The mandu was good, though it wasn’t particularly standout compared to the other dishes on the table.\n\nBut what truly made the evening special was the outstanding service from SJ. He was friendly, professional, and incredibly attentive throughout our meal. He checked in at just the right moments, made thoughtful recommendations, and went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and happy. His positive energy and genuine hospitality really stood out and made our dining experience unforgettable.\n\nWe’ll definitely be coming back, not only for the amazing food but also because SJ made us feel so welcome. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great Korean food and top-tier service!",

The food was cleanly presented and well-prepared across the board.\n\nWe ordered samgyeopsal (grilled pork belly), and while the meat was fresh and nicely grilled, do note that you need to order lettuce (sangchu) and green onion salad (pa-jeori) separately if you want the full Korean BBQ experience.\n\nThe seolleongtang (ox bone soup) came with plenty of noodles and egg, offering a comforting, mild flavor. The haemul-pajeon (seafood pancake) was crisp and flavorful, packed with seafood. The dolsot-bibimbap (stone pot bibimbap) was deliciously well-balanced, with a perfect mix of textures and flavors.\n\nOne particularly touching gesture was when the staff kindly offered roasted seaweed and fruit for the children — a warm and thoughtful touch that made us feel truly welcome.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone craving authentic Korean food with exceptional hospitality.",
