Shout out to Gabriel for the engaging and enjoyable service he provided, as that really took it from a very good time to an exceptional one.\n\nFood was ordered after taking our server's recommendations into account, which we highly recommend doing. When we went, we especially loved dishes featuring beetroot & blueberries with pine nuts, roasted leeks with almond romesco, and a cassoulet with cep & smoked tofu, and a dessert featuring an orange & bergamot pudding (pictures included). If still available on the menu, also recommend trying the low-ABV drinks from AMA brewery.\n\nThe atmosphere is inviting and lively without being loud. Highly suggest to anyone who has a chance to go!",
