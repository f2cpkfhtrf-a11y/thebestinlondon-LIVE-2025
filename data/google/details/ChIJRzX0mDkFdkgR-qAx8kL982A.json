      "text": "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nDinner by Heston Blumenthal is more than a meal — it’s a journey through history on a plate. Each dish is inspired by centuries-old recipes, reimagined with modern flair. The Plum Meat Fruit (a playful twist on chicken liver parfait disguised as a plum) was the star — surprising, rich, and delightful. The Seabass with Green Sauce was roasted to tender perfection, the seabass paired beautifully with a herbaceous green sauce made of parsley, basil, garlic, and lemon. Bright, zesty, and refreshing — my best main course of the night., while the Hereford Beef with mushroom ketchup showcased perfect cooking and deep umami, paired with unforgettable triple-cooked fries.\n\nDon’t miss the legendary Tipsy Cake (1858, J.H. Walsh): The restaurant’s other viral and absolutely unmissable dish! A freshly rolled brioche baked for an hour, soaked every 15–20 minutes with vanilla, dessert wine, and brandy until it jiggles when it comes out of the oven. Served with pineapple roasted for 4–5 hours and glazed in apple caramel — smoky, caramelized, and delicious. I expected stronger alcohol notes, but it was more subtle — still a showstopper dessert that everyone seemed to order!\n\nComplimentary Christmas Minced Chocolate Pies: A festive surprise! Instead of meat, finely chopped chocolate mimicked minced filling — sweet, rich, and perfectly seasonal.\n\nService was attentive and knowledgeable, with staff explaining the history behind each dish in a warm, approachable way. The ambience is elegant yet comfortable, making the whole experience feel like both a dinner and a journey through time.\n\nDinner by Heston isn’t just a restaurant, it’s a historical adventure brought to life on the plate. A must-visit in London for an extraordinary dining experience! A memorable birthday dinner for my mom!",

      "text": "We came here expecting a world-class dining experience from given the 2-star Michelin restaurant, and instead left wondering how on earth this establishment still holds even one star.\n\nFirst, the food: it was good, but far from spectacular. Certainly not the kind of culinary artistry you’d expect at this level. Honestly, the flavors merited a Bib Gourmand at best, not a coveted Michelin star.\n\nBut the real downfall of the evening was the service, which was appalling from start to finish. The restaurant itself feels like it’s tucked into a strip mall—hardly the atmosphere you’d expect for such a highly touted establishment. We were celebrating a birthday, which we noted both when booking and upon arrival. We were assured they would do something special. After over two hours of dining, the check came, and nothing had been done nor was the birthday even acknowledge by the service staff. Only when we mentioned it again did the staff scramble to throw something together—by which point we were ready to leave. That lack of care and detail is inexcusable and genuinely upsetting.\n\nThe sommelier was equally disappointing, offering little guidance and the wines were quite overpriced. Worse, the pours were essentially half pours if that—utterly unacceptable at this level of dining and price point. The manager later addressed this when it was brought to her attention and comped the wine, which was appreciated, but by then the damage had been done.\n\nAs for the rest of the service, it was shockingly poor for a Michelin-starred restaurant. Servers were dismissive, inattentive, and completely devoid of the polish expected at this level. The only thing they had going for them were they were dressed well. At a true 2 Michelin Star establishment, you expect staff to anticipate needs, escort you when leaving the table, and discreetly refolding napkins. None of this happened. Instead, when we politely asked our server how she was doing at the beginning of the meal, she replied, “Well, I’m working on a Sunday so not great.” That’s a response better suited to a casual diner, not a restaurant that claims two Michelin stars.\n\nWe’ve dined at multiple 1, 2, and 3-star restaurants, and this was by far the worst. It’s shocking and frankly appalling that Michelin continues to recognize this restaurant at such a high level.\n\nThe manager’s apologies aside, the evening was ruined. What should have been a memorable birthday dinner to cap off a great trip to London turned into an exercise in disappointment. We will not be returning nor going to any of Heston Blumenthal’s restaurants in the future.\n\nIn short: the food was fine, the service was unforgivable, and the entire experience left us questioning how this establishment could be considered fine dining. A true disappointment in every sense.",

      "text": "Our experience at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal was nothing short of excellent. We went for the tasting menu during dinner service and could scarcely have asked for anything better.\nThe dining room was stylish without being stuffy and had a great ambience. One of the very few less-than-stellar aspects was the bathroom location. With the restaurant being in Mandarin Oriental Hotel, the bathroom was quite a walk so much so that staff had to lead you to it the first time. Other than that however, the location and style were excellent.\nThe food, as to be expected from a 2 Michelin Star restaurant by Heston Blumenthal no less, was exceptional. Everything from the first bites to the last surprise(s) was fantastic. The standouts in my view were the lobster, chicken liver pate, and beef. But then again it seems maybe unfair to choose a favorite. Towards the end of the meal there was a long break where we thought we were waiting for the bill, but instead a cart was brought out to make liquid nitrogen ice cream (yeah, I know). It made for a delightful semi-end to a wonderful meal.\nLastly, the little bits of history and historical inspiration truly make this restaurant unique among others.\nFinal verdict: treat yourself; you won’t forget nor regret it.",

The presentation of the food was amazing, and the knowledge of all the staff involved was very interesting, making us feel very looked after.\n\nThe entire meal was out of this world. We enjoyed lunch for our double celebration: my special birthday and my son’s master’s degree graduation. Every detail was perfectly executed, and the attention to detail was truly impressive.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious, and the ambience was lovely and relaxed. We highly recommend this restaurant.\n\nWe VERY highly recommend you book to enjoy this for yourself. Easily the BEST restaurant we’ve ever been to in the UK\nThank you",

They’ve got this fun card system so you decide if you want the dish explained, the history, or nothing at all—love that touch. Food-wise, Tipsy Cake and the rib were spot on, but the Meat Fruit… wow. Clever, fun, and insanely tasty. Totally worth trying!",
