My friend and I ordered the three cut sharing roast, almost all of it was inedible.\n\nThe chicken was cold and had a weird sickly sweet taste.  The lamb was grey in colour and chewy.  The broccoli tasted sour.  The parsnips were undercooked and hard.  I could only eat the beef, which was nice, the potatoes and carrots and the Yorkshire.\n\nMy drink was also supposed to be made with caramelised apple but they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have any‚Äù so they just served it with fresh apple but still charged me the same price.  Aren‚Äôt you supposed to caramelise the apple upon order? üôÑ I would not ever come back here and I‚Äôm just grateful I didn‚Äôt end up with food poisoning.",

The calamari and the cabbage in particular were absolutely sensational.The cocktails were equally impressive, absolutely delicious.\nA special mention goes to Daniela, who assisted me over the phone with my reservation. She was incredibly friendly and accommodating, setting a positive tone for the evening. The entire staff demonstrated professionalism and warmth, making the dining experience even more enjoyable.\nA lovely surprise during my meal was when the head chef personally came to my table to check if everything met my expectations‚Äîsuch a thoughtful and genuine gesture that made the experience feel even more special.\nFrom start to finish, everything exceeded my expectations.
