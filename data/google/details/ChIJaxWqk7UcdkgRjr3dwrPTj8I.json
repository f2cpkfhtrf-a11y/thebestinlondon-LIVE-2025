Some of the fusion dishes are not particularly pushing the edge but others are a bit more adventurous. They also give samples of their kimchis and have kombucha as well. The owners are interesting and have specific philosophies on life which they are eager to share if asked. None of the food is fried which is great for those who avoid fried foods. The location is also great for those who want to spend a day exploring Brick Lane and the many things it has to offer.",

As soon as we arrived, the staff invited us to taste five different types of kimchi so we could choose our favorite to pair with our dish. It was such an interesting and thoughtful touch to the service. But anyhow service is a bit slow because they don’t have much staff to attend. We ordered many items and enjoyed almost all of them. The kimchi was well-fermented, the kombucha was tasty, and the chocolate onigiri was a real standout—so good! Definitely planning to go back again.",

It was okay, service was very, very, slow so if you are in a hurry, don’t go here.\n\nGot the sushi burger which was good and the kimchi pasta which tasted like they mashed up some gnocchi and mixed it was well seasoned though. The only thing is, the pasta was too cooked through so it was mushy.  Also got the seaweed which was okay. I wish it was a bit more salted and seasoned.\n\nOverall, okay. I didn’t get any drinks, just tap water.\n\nFYI, cash is preferred at this place and I don’t believe they have a restroom. I asked if there is a bathroom to go wash my hands and the server said no and brought me hand sanitizer.",

The concept and overall vibe immediately won me over.\n\nThe service was extremely friendly, attentive, and full of great recommendations. I especially enjoyed the little kimchi tasting at the beginning. I ordered the Kimchi Burger, but also got to try the Kimchi Bruschetta – both were absolutely delicious, packed with flavor, and really creative.\n\nTo finish, I had the dark chocolate mochi, which was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal.\n\nOverall, Vegan Yes is not only a must-visit for vegans but for anyone who appreciates thoughtful, flavorful food. Highly recommended!",
