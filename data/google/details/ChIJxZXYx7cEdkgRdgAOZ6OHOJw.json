Fantastic curries including mutton which was excellent and monkfish as well as the classic Chicken Ruby. The Biryani was great with a jackfruit option for the non meat eaters and the black daal was amazing! Some excellent drink options too with refreshing lassis, trendy cocktails and the classic Kingfisher beer and Thums Up Asian cola. Would recommend booking in advance as gets very busy with queues often spanning round the block. Service can be touch and go particularly during busy periods where you’re often fighting to get someone’s attention but overall a great experience with delicious food.",

They dine you fast so don’t be discouraged by the long lines. We walked in on a busy Saturday evening & managed to snag a table in 30 mins. The vibe of the restaurant is electric, two floors packed with customers & waiters running around harmoniously. It’s really a well run restaurant with top customer service. The menu is intriguing & drool worthy. We tried a bunch of the things - pav bhaji, house chaat, chicken ruby, garlic naan & Kashmiri Chili ice cream. All taste good, but not out of this world good. They do the nail that Bombay Irani cafe vibe & overall it’s a crowd pleaser of a place. Dishoom is an impressive place to visit but isn’t necessarily a memorable one. Again, it doesn’t need this critique as it does a commendable job and it’s gonna thrive for years to come.",

We waited maybe 20 minutes for a table for 6 (5 humans and a toddler) which wasn't bad in my opinion.  Our waiter insanely attentive.  We ordered drinks and I wanted to try their chai, but he said I should have something fun so he made it a ~naughty chai~ but then also brought me a regular chai just to try it too.  He brought out a milk for our toddler and it was just slightly warmed (nice touch).  We talked about how we went to Dehli a few years ago and that's where our waiter was from originally, so he brought us out a local dish that we didn't try while we were there.. very thoughtful!  You name it, we got it to try.. vegetable samosas, chili chicken, butter chicken, chicken biryani (the cranberries were actually a surprisingly great touch), the House Black Daal, the broccoli salad, cheese naan, garlic naan, raita.. nothing missed.  We stuffed ourselves silly.  We also came here to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday and at the end he brought out THREE desserts for her which was insanely nice.  I swear it was the most welcoming restaurant and atmosphere.  I wish I could come back every month.",
