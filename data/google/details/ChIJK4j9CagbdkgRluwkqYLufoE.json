The tables are extremely close together so it feels like you’re sat on top of your neighbours. The service is very mediocre.\n\nThe waitress took the order for your the meal and the first round of drinks that’s about it. I was extremely disappointed to witness a member of staff using the toilet without washing their hands. Quite off putting knowing this when you’ve just eaten your meal.\n\nFood was very tasty and this would be the reason we would visit again. Reasonably priced and good portion sizes.\n\nThe dessert however was very disappointing and we felt ripped off when it arrived. £14 for a slice of what tasted like dry shop bought cold chocolate cake. A tiny amount of chocolate sauce on the top didn’t help with the dryness would defo avoid!\n\nOverall a decent experience for the food alone but it sadly lets itself down in many other aspects.\n\nRecommendations are required",

The interiors are beautifully decorated, featuring elegant Italian ceramic plates and a warm, inviting atmosphere. The place is spotless and well-kept, making it a delight to dine in.\n\nService:\nThe service was excellent—friendly, attentive, and quick, which made the evening even more enjoyable.\n\nFood:\nThe quality of ingredients truly matches what you’d expect in Italy. We started with the Trio d’Olive, which was fresh and flavourful, and the Mozzarella in Carrozza—crispy on the outside, perfectly cheesy inside, and served with a delicious tomato sauce.\n\nFor my main, I had the Mafaldine al Tartufo, which was incredibly delicious—rich, aromatic, and bursting with truffle flavour. I highly recommend trying this dish.\n\nMy husband ordered the Tagliolini Granchio e Limone. It was decent, but didn’t quite match the wow factor of the truffle pasta.\n\nNote: The only downside was that the toilets were a little dirty and had an unpleasant smell. However, this did not take away from the fact that the restaurant itself is really nice, clean, and beautifully maintained.\n\nOverall, we had a memorable anniversary dinner, and I would definitely return—especially for that Mafaldine al Tartufo!",

We started with the burrata- absolute perfection floating on a delicious tomato reduction. For our main course we paired the ragu with a Sicily wine, it was fresh and delicious. To end our beautiful experience, we had the tiramisu! Both the food, service, and atmosphere were outstanding- we will be back!",

      "text": "From the outside this looks like a quiet unassuming restaurant. Once you get inside it turns into a huge barn-sized place. Interesting decor as all the photos in reviews show. Bottle display is impressive. Because it’s all open inside it can be quite loud with conversation, which combined with the semi-disco feel of the music makes for a high energy vibe. The food choice is varied enough to satisfy most tastes in my opinion. Quality is decent. I had pizza, smashed potatoes and stracciatella. The latter was novel for me and very nice as an appetizer. Service is reasonably efficient although they did forget the pizza order; they recovered quickly and all was well for us. Draft beer is from a local craft brewery. It appears to be an extremely busy place even for lunch, so reservations are a must; you can’t call and bookings are done online. That turned out to be easy and we got a reminder email well in advance. If you want a little bit of a quieter meal ask to be seated at the back behind the kitchen. It’s popular for birthdays and celebrations. Worth a visit if you plan on being in Oxford street.",

The restaurant is absolutely beautiful – warm lighting, bottles and postcards everywhere, and flowers hanging from the ceiling. Even the toilets are gorgeous with their unique Italian style!\n\nThe food was incredible – especially the carbonara, which they make right in front of you in a cheese wheel. The cocktails were great too, and I loved the quirky glasses they came in. The staff were so kind and attentive, and even gave us an anniversary card, which was such a sweet surprise. Paying was super easy through a QR code and Apple Pay.\n\nThe only downsides were that it was quite warm inside, and there’s an extra platform charge when paying, which feels a bit unfair.\n\nOverall, it’s a stunning restaurant with amazing food, lovely staff, and a great atmosphere – perfect for a date night or special occasion!",
