The mango mocktail was a bit on the sweet side, but very refreshing. The service was excellent—they kindly charged both my laptop and phone without hesitation, and everything was served promptly. Sitting outside with a view of the Thames made the whole experience even better. Thank you",

      "text": "Tucked beside the legendary Tower Bridge, Coco Grill & Lounge is a gem for a relaxed dinner with friends, especially on a mild evening like the one we enjoyed. My group and I headed there for a casual catch-up, drawn by the outdoor seating and those unbeatable views. We weren’t let down – the terrace setup is spot-on, with tables positioned to capture the full sweep of the bridge arching over the Thames. As we settled in under the cool breeze drifting off the river, it felt like the perfect backdrop for good conversation and laughter. The ambience is inviting: lively hum from fellow diners mixed with the gentle water sounds, all wrapped in a stylish, modern vibe that’s pure London charm. It’s got that effortless Instagram appeal too – we couldn’t resist a few group shots with the bridge glowing in the background.\nDinner kicked off on a high note. We shared a fresh salad to start, which was light and zingy, followed by the fire-grilled chicken that stole the show – smoky, perfectly spiced with a real fiery edge that cut through the breeze-chilled air. It paired seamlessly with the salad, and the portions hit just right for sharing among friends, leaving us full but not stuffed.\nThere were a couple of small hitches along the way. We’d spotted shisha mentions in online reviews and thought it’d be a fun add-on, but they’d quietly dropped it from the menu about a month back without updating Google – a minor surprise that we shrugged off by focusing on the food and views instead. Service was warm and capable overall, though on our bustling night, it took a beat longer than ideal to grab the waiter’s eye for extras like drink refills.\nIn the end, the stunning Tower Bridge panorama, that refreshing cool breeze, and easygoing spot with pals make Coco Grill & Lounge a solid pick for a neutral-good night out. It’s all about the location and simple pleasures here, with just a nudge needed for those finer details. Solid 3.5 stars from our friends – the scenery and shared bites tipped the scales.",

The lamb shank was a real star – slow-cooked to perfection, juicy and packed with flavour. And the desserts… wow. Both the chocolate soufflé and the French toast were heavenly – indulgent, comforting, and the kind of dishes you’d happily go back for again and again.\n\nCocktails and drinks were just as impressive, crafted with care and served beautifully. What stood out most though was the team – genuinely friendly, professional, and making sure every detail was perfect. Service like that really elevates the whole experience.\n\nCoco is definitely one of those places I’d recommend to anyone wanting great food, faultless desserts, and standout hospitality near Tower Bridge. 🍷✨",
