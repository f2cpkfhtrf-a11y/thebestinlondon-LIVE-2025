The wine and cocktail selection was excellent too, with something for everyone and perfectly paired with the meal.\n\nThe service was second to none. Every single member of staff was attentive, knowledgeable, and welcoming, which made the whole day run seamlessly.\n\nThe courtyard looked stunning, and the team went above and beyond both in the set-up and in the lead-up to the big day. Their care and attention to detail truly exceeded our expectations and the planning process was so relaxed and enjoyable.\n\nStanley’s helped make our wedding day so special, and we’ll treasure the memories forever. We’re already looking forward to coming back with friends and family – a glass of wine on the terrace will be the perfect way to relive those happy moments!\n\nThank you to Peter, Hugh and the whole team – you really made our day unforgettable.",
