I called ahead due to train delays, and Kimberly kindly reassured me they would hold our table, a huge relief on such a special day.\nFrom start to finish, everything was perfect. The ambience is relaxed yet vibrant, even the restrooms are beautifully designed, with calming ocean sounds. The food was delicious, thoughtfully presented, and portions were just right. We didn’t even finish everything, which surprised us!\nA heartfelt thank you to Swiz, who truly made our experience exceptional. She was warm, attentive, and explained the menu with care, suggesting drinks tailored to our preferences and they were exactly what we loved. Her service struck the perfect balance of professionalism and friendliness without ever rushing us.\nThe birthday surprise was the cherry on top: a small dessert brought out with a lit candle, a handwritten “Happy Birthday” card, and a tiny gift box tied with a bow containing a bite-sized sweet. My friend described it as “a little piece of heaven.” That thoughtful gesture made her day.\nIt was our first time at Milk Beach Soho and certainly won’t be the last. Absolutely memorable in every way.",

The atmosphere was welcoming and stylish, and from the moment we arrived the service was friendly, attentive, and professional. The food was absolutely delicious—fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. Every dish we tried felt thoughtfully prepared and exceeded our expectations.\n\nOverall, Milk Beach is a fantastic spot that combines great service with outstanding food. We’ll definitely be back and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting SoHo.",

From the moment we arrived, the service stood out - the host who checked our reservation was warm and welcoming, and our waitress was lovely throughout.\n\nWe sat out on the patio, which truly gave off beach day vibes - the atmosphere felt like a little summer escape in the middle of Soho. We were a group of six, and everything was handled smoothly and efficiently.\n\nWe tried a good number of cocktails (all fantastic), and honestly worked our way through most of the menu ; which, while not huge, is well-curated. The portions were generous, the food was excellent, and the setting just elevated the whole afternoon.\nHighly recommend for a relaxed, sun-soaked outing with great food, drinks, and service.",

The classes were super well run – Brittney did an amazing job organising everything and bringing in great instructors who made the sessions both challenging and enjoyable. After the workouts, everyone hung out over share plates and cocktails, which was the perfect way to relax and connect with others. On top of that, there were lots of goodies given out just for attending, which was such a nice surprise. Overall, such a well put together event – can’t wait for the next one!",
