When we went we learnt that it was newly opened, a few months old. We got a table downstairs and were the only ones there. Perfect.\n\nThe server was friendly and helpful. She recommended dishes to us and the food came quickly. Portion sizes are small which would have been perfect for sharing in smaller groups. (I say that because we usually dine with 3-4 people and some dishes are so large that trying food is difficult because of the large amount.) This time there were 12 of us so we just doubled up. Everything was delicious! I didn’t manage to photo everything because the children were hungry. The roast duck was so good. This is definitely kid-friendly food.\n\nI really hope this restaurant stays. It’s a great addition to the neighborhood.",

Overall, this is one of the best Cantonese meals I’ve had in London recently.\n\n💡 Drinks\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐ Lion Eye: A lychee & longan mocktail, refreshing and lightly sweet without being overwhelming.\n\n⭐⭐⭐ Elderflower Zest: Tastes like elderflower soda, non-alcoholic but with a hint of “boozy” character.\n\n🍴 Dishes\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐ ¼ Roast Duck: Distinct from Beijing or Nanjing styles—Hong Kong–style roast with rich, slightly sweet soy-based flavor. Would be perfect with a plum sauce.\n\n⭐⭐⭐ Salt & Pepper Squid: Tasty, but too much batter; the crunch overpowered the squid itself.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐ Salted Egg Yolk Prawns: Bold, savory flavor with plump prawns. Not too heavy—perfect for those who love salted egg dishes.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐ Chongqing Chili Chicken: More numbing (málà) than spicy, dry-fried style, very suitable for Cantonese palates while still keeping Sichuan flavor.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Fried Wontons: Absolute favorite. Thin, crispy skin with big, juicy shrimp inside. Paired with a sweet-spicy sauce—unmissable.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐ Custard Lava Buns: Sadly, the filling wasn’t runny since we didn’t eat them immediately, but still tasty with a more savory salted egg yolk filling (not the sweet custard type).\n\n⭐⭐⭐ “Mouthwatering Chicken”: Decent, but not the highlight compared to other dishes. Still solid, but overshadowed.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐ Braised Wheat Gluten: First time having this in the UK—closer to frozen tofu in texture, pleasantly flavorful.",

The braised pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and the drunken chicken was perfectly seasoned. The service was warm and attentive, and the atmosphere was cozy yet stylish.

      "text": "Shan Shui is really a solid place - good variety with Veggie options and well made in its approach to an authentic but also causal dining experience. We ordered quite a bit between three people but the prices weren’t anything you wouldn’t expect from a central London restaurant. Top favourites were the Kafou (pardon my spelling) a very unique but delicious dish, prawn wontons, braised mushroom and tofu with rice, char siu and roast duck. It was very delicious only minor notes the noodles in the char siu and prawn wontons dish weren’t the easiest to eat even for the most vetted chop stick user and the sauce was a bit salty I think that would’ve been a better choice in a soup form instead of dry. Also the chilli crab Bao was actually very tasty but …. Where was the crab a mere thought apparently cause there wasnt much in the Bao, luckily whatever filling they did have was still very tasty. I would defo visit again just maybe with more soup options !!",
