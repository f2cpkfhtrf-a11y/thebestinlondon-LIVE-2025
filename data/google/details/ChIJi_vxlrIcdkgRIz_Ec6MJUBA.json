The whole vibe of the restaurant felt so vibrant and elevated, yet cozy and welcoming at the same time.\n\nThe staff were so friendly, attentive, and made sure we were well taken care of all night. The food? Incredible. I had the ribs, and they were so good — tender, flavorful, just perfect. I also tried this sweet potato baked dish and some sweet corn on the side, and everything was delicious. You can tell a lot of care goes into every single plate. It’s one of those spots that leaves you smiling long after you’ve left. Definitely a must-visit when in London!",

We had to request someone to take the drinks orders. The set menu which was 90£ look likes it it had a range of different dish. All the portions are small. I don't believe it was enough for all six of us. Some came with like two bowls which is fine if the food was good. The only thing that really stood out was the lamb chops. They were okay. The prawns weren't that nice at all. The sushi was okay but I've had so much better sushi in angel for Half the price. If you're paying for the view then the view is amazing but the food not that great was expecting so much better.",
