A queue formed around me, and it definitely consisted of more than 10 people.\n\nAll staff members I encountered were so friendly and helpful. Really impressed me, from front of house to wait staff.\n\nBeautiful environment, I liked the calming colour scheme and decor very much. Comfortable seating, and nice bathrooms also.\n\nI did manage to get the burger (which I overheard had sold out, and when I checked my watch it was 12:08pm!) and it was really good. Simple, quality, wholesome. It was juicy, and so messy to eat. So flavoursome. Had no idea how to eat it so I made a right mess of it, but no shame here. I can’t bring myself to call it the best burger I’ve ever eaten; something is holding me back from that, but I can’t tell you what. Because I ate quite slowly, maybe it was that the lightly toasted bun dried out a little by the time I ate the second half.\n\nI ordered a side of fries, this was a step too far for me. I would have been satisfied without these, I’m not sure if my appetite is small or normal though so I speak for myself. The fries were really good, but quite expensive compared to the burger.\n\nBill came to £36, this included - burger, fries, still water, a fresh lemon iced tea and service charge.\n\nOn a Sunday the street parking is free. I found a space a few minutes / short walk away. I imagine on all other days it’s either expensive or tricky to find a space.",
