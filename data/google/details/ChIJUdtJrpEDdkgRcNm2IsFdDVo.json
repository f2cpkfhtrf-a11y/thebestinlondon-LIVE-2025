Every dish balanced textures, spices, and citrus so perfectly. My partner and I shared 2 small plates and the whole sea bass special, which was a perfect amount of food for us. The corn ribs are a must-try! The sea bass was- by far- the best sea bass I’ve had. The fry was perfect and light, the garnishes fresh and balanced, and the green coriander sauce was so bright and punchy!",

There is a 3 course meal menu which 3 of our group of 6 wanted but you can only have it if everyone at the table wants it which was disappointing but this meant we actually spent less money so that’s their choice to make. The whole Bridget jones apartment thing feels a bit mis-sold. She lived in the loft and the restaurant is on the first floor. I know the place is now a restaurant and would have changed a lot but I couldn’t even find a familiar window in the restaurant. You could see stairs going up from the restaurant which was all painted white like in the film but you couldn’t go up there. So if you’re going for the Bridget Jones experience don’t bother but if you like Thai food this was a nice place to visit. The young lady that served us was great. The cocktails were around £12 my one was so small it was like a shoot so didn’t order more. I don’t mean to sound negative we actually had a lovely time and the food was great. The Bridget blue cocktail went down well so some people in our group had 2. We also had to pay a £30 service charge which worked out £5 each. Just a warning in case you’re not expecting it.",

The food was sumptuous, vibrant, and full of flavour — especially the lemongrass chicken, which was perfectly grilled and aromatic, and the som tam, which struck the perfect balance of tangy, spicy, and refreshing. We also tried the khao soi - rich, comforting, and deliciously complex.\n\nTo finish, we had the fried doughnut with cinnamon ice cream, and it was a standout — warm, crispy, and beautifully paired with the cool, spiced ice cream.\n\nA huge thank you to the staff for their warm and attentive service. Special shoutout to Bella, who made our dining experience even more enjoyable with her friendly smile and thoughtful recommendations. She went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.\n\nThe portion sizes aren’t particularly large, but the quality and flavour more than make up for it.",
