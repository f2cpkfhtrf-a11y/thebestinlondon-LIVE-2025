It just kept on coming and coming. Lol. At some point we had to stop the starters as we suddenly remembered that the main meal was still on the way.\nIn the spirit of going all out, I had ordered the Tomahawk 1KG as well.\n\nThe steak was really good, cooked just right. At this point the red wine had started its number on me but the steak came and doused it down a bit lol.\n\nI have had a few “brunches” around town, but ROKA actually is easily a top 3 experience. The service just made the time there much much better.\n\nI’d definitely go back again.",

      "text": "Favourable & Delightful Experience – But Not Perfect 4/5\n\nTwo of us came here for lunch with high expectations after reading glowing reviews and dining at many top establishments. We were very hungry and ready to be impressed.\n\nUpon arrival, we were warmly greeted and taken to our seats. Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and took the time to explain his recommendations. We opted for the seasonal tasting menu at £88 per person, having been assured there would be plenty of food.\n\nThe Meal:\n\nThe dishes started to arrive, one by one:\n•\tSake to Avokado Maki (raw salmon, avocado, and asparagus, with wasabi tobiko and tenkasu): Fresh, clean flavours, complemented nicely by the wasabi and ginger. Much better than any supermarket sushi.\n•\tGoma Fuumi no Horenso Salada (spinach leaves with sesame dressing – GF, VG): Light, tasty, and refreshing. A great addition to any meal – highly recommend.\n•\tSashimi Moriawase (tuna, seabass, and salmon sashimi): Two small pieces of each fish. Very fresh, but a bit bland on their own. The soy sauce helped bring some life to them.\n•\tHamachi no Taru Taru (yellowtail tartare, lemon, chilli, and ginger pearls – GF): Fresh and mildly flavoured, but didn’t stand out. Served with two thin edible crackers that reminded me of light Quavers – not very impactful in flavour.\n•\tGyuniku to Goma no Gyoza (beef, ginger, and sesame dumplings): The highlight of the meal! Crispy outside, juicy and flavourful inside, paired with a delicious sauce, chillies, and cucumber. We only wished there were more – two each wasn’t enough!\n•\tKuruma-Ebi (tiger prawn tempura with tentsuyu and spicy yuzu sauce): Another standout. Served hot and fresh, with a satisfying crunch. Left a warm, hearty feeling.\n•\tKobuta no Ribs Yawaraka Nikomiyaki (baby back pork ribs with sansho and cashew nuts): Great flavour and texture, though the ribs were small with little meat.\n\nMain Dishes:\n1.\tHinadori no Lemon Miso Yaki (cedar roast baby chicken with chilli and lemon – GF): My favourite main dish. Bold, mouthwatering flavours. Served hot and packed a punch.\n2.\tKonasu (eggplant in mirin, ginger, and soy – GF, VG): Moist and sweet with a distinct flavour. If you’re a fan of eggplant, you’ll enjoy it – though it wasn’t quite to my taste.\n3.\tTai no Miso-Yaki (seabream fillet, ryotei miso, and red onion – GF): Very soft and fresh, with delicate flavours. A nice contrast to the other dishes, though it didn’t stand out in terms of taste.\n\nDessert:\n\nWe ended with the Roka Dessert Platter. Everything was enjoyable except the sticky toffee pudding, which was overcooked, dry, and tough – a real letdown.\n\nExtras:\n\nWe had four Diet Cokes between us and a bottle of water, priced at £5.95. There’s also a £1 charity donation added to the bill and a 14.5% service charge (optional, but included automatically).\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nOur total came to £226.51 for two. It’s definitely on the expensive side, and while the service was excellent and many dishes impressed, not everything lived up to the hype. Some items lacked depth or portion size for the price.\n\nThat said, we still had a great experience. I’d highly recommend select dishes (like the gyoza, prawn tempura, and baby chicken), but others I’d probably skip next time.",

We were part of a large group, dining on the 2nd floor terrace and had a set menu, which meant we got to try many of the delicious dishes that Roka has to offer from the Tasting Menu.\n\nAbsolute stand outs included; Yellowtail Sashimi, Rock Shrimp Tempura, Lamb Cutlets with Korean Spices, Angus Beef fillet and the Black Cod marinated in yuzu miso. The assorted Roka dessert was also amazing, so much variety to enjoy.\n\nA broad range of drinks options to suit most preferences is also available. And the service was polite, but a little slow.",
