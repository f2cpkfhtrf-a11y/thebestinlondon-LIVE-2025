My starter (house style aubergine) was one of the best things I’ve ever eaten at a restaurant, and the others in my group also thoroughly enjoyed theirs (croquettes and corn soup). The service was extremely understanding and helpful when I told them about my nut allergy and brought me a different menu. For my main I chose the truffle rosso pasta due to my allergy. The sauce was quite nice - my complaint would be that the pasta was slightly too soft and was falling apart which was likely due to its being gluten free so I understand that was probably unavoidable. The portions were huge so unfortunately I had no space for dessert, but my companions said the black forest tart was fantastic. Highly recommend KIN; favourite dishes were the aubergine and corn soup small plates.",
