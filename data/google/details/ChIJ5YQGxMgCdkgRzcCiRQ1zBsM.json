The location at Canary Wharf might not be ideal, yet it is right in front of the river with amazing view over centtal London skyline, so a plus already for terrace sitting if weathwr allows.\nNext is service. Perfect. Polite, attentive, not intrusive yet always there whenever you need something.\nFinally the food. We went for Gaucho's classic: Argentinian meet. We took different cuts and ALL of the were cooked according to each one request, from filete to ribeye steaks, different sizes and some marinated. All amazing.\n\nWe went for Argentinian malvec... quite overpriced yet very good.\n\nAll together in a cosy place.\n\nJust excellent experience end-to-end.\n\nIllustration: 400 ribeye steak for 52£\n\nLabels: 2eat, $$$$, #Argentinian, #romantic, #privees, #terrace, #views, #must Go",

The food and drinks were absolutely delightful, and the atmosphere made it even better. While I felt the prices were a bit on the high side, the quality of what I had definitely justified it.

Gauchos is a restaurant that I had been to before, many years ago & the presentation of the restaurant is still very good.\nWe ordered cocktails which were ok. I don’t usually drink but as I was celebrating I had a pornstar martini which was nice but I usually feel a little tipsy after one of these but with this one I didn’t. The others like their cocktails but they also said they lacked any taste with regard to alcohol content.\nWe all ordered from the set lunch menu. It was 3 courses for £19.95\nWe had the Prawn Chicharron for starters. It was lovely! I would definitely order this from the main menu, if it guaranteed that I got a bigger portion😊10/10\nMains, we had Rump & chips. I also ordered a side of tenderstem broccoli. The steaks were nice, not amazing, but nice. I was hoping for home made chips, even if I was only given a few chips presented nicely. Sadly, it looked like we were given McCain chips 6.5/10\nThey tasted ok though.\nThe broccoli was weird. It had peanuts crumbed on it & some sort of drizzled sauce. We didn’t like it 2/10\nFor dessert we all had Chocolate Brownie with  white chocolate ice cream. I love desserts. It was adequate. We were all unsure on the taste of the ice cream 7/10.\nOoh..! They did write happy birthday on my plate with my dessert & put a candle in it, which was really nice. Thank you ❤️\n\nOnly gripe is, when we were eating dessert not all of us had finished & the plates were collected. He then made one of our party feel rushed & uneasy.\n\nI will say that the aesthetics of the restaurant are lovely. The staff were pleasant. The food, for the price, was really good.\n\nP.s your bathrooms could do with a little bit more light.\n\nI would definitely return to this restaurant",
