It’s a shame, as everything else was fantastic.",

My partner and I ordered through the online system, which was easy enough, but his food arrived 20 minutes before mine. In the meantime, two customers who arrived and ordered after us received their meals (at least in part), and no one checked in with us until we followed up. My partner even waited to start eating, yet when my order finally came, there was no acknowledgment or apology for the delay.\n\nThe flavor of my kimbap was fine, but nearly half of the pieces fell apart before I could even pick them up, which further soured the overall experience. Unfortunate, but oh well!",
