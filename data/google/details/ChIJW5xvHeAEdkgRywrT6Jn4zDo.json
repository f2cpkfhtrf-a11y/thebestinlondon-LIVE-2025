Even though the reviews were mixed, as mostly was quite promising we braved ourselves to try out this place.\nThe Good(s):\nAtmosphere is quite Mexican theme, nice and had various art on the wall with good music. They have these Mexican hats which creates quirky fun for the diners.\nFood were all decent portions - nachos were great, so was the prawns we had and BBQ ribs and wings.\nThe food was all edible - everything was nice but not really a wow factor that makes me think, I want to come back here again.\nThe Bad(s):\nWe wanted to get Starters sharer platter of 4 and they had beef as part of it but our family do not eat beef. We asked if we could exchange to another meat but the chef didn't allow, not even we offered to pay extra. And due to limitations, its either this platter or vegetarian platter.\nThe staff were friendly but I think they could be students. So a staff brought our mains and repeated the order, for example Chimichanga Beef. we reminded we didn't order any beef and he looked confused. The right food was served but he announced it as beef.\nBased on my previous experiences, Fajita bread comes in an enclosed container so that the bread retains the heat and the dish normally comes out on a sizzling hot plate - the drama is on the sizzle dish. But it was neither, no sizzling and the fajita bread came by the side. Last but least, all food served (except breaded mushroom) was luke warm. It wasnt hot - its almost like its been sitting in kitchen for a while before it was served.\nFor the reasons above, its a 3 star review.\nThe experience was decent, not great and for that reason I don't think we will be back here again.",

This place is a rare find – halal Mexican food done right. The menu is packed with veggie-friendly options, so there’s something for everyone.\n\nThe lunch menu is ideal for work breaks or casual catch-ups, with generous portions and solid value. I also loved the non-alcoholic drinks – refreshing and full of flavour.\n\nThe vibe? Cosy and colourful, with cool Mexican-themed artwork and traditional sombreros adding a fun, laid-back touch to the space.\n\nIf you’re in the area, definitely worth checking out. A welcome change from the usual lunch spots!",
