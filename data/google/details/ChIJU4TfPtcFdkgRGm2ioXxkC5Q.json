The menu is fixed price and it's clear before you arrive whats included so do take a look at the menu before booking to be sure it's right for you. We had  3 x soft tacos, rice and a dessert. All were great and quite filling. To drink, it was as much Prosecco and frozen margarita's as you fancy in the 2 hours.  The atmosphere is fun and loud. The views are great given it's a rooftop restaurant. Would recommend if you are looking for somewhere fun with friends especially if it's not all about the food and more about having a good time.",

Even with minimal alcohol I would've been atleast a bit tipsy. Instead I had a lot of sugar. There's also a.prosecco option but that has sulphites and gives me a migraine.\n\nThe tacos were okay. Nothing to scream about.\nThe rice that accompanied them was undercooked and crunchy. You could cut it with your nail and see the white line in each grain. Rice isn't hard to get right.\n\nAnd for dessert, the churros were nice and chewy but the sauce??? When you burn chocolate it almost tastes sour. I tried to salvage it by mixing the white chocolate with it but no. Just had the churros.\n\nThe view is nice but wouldn't come again.",

The atmosphere was vibrant and full of energy — perfect for a fun evening out.\n\nThe view over London was absolutely breathtaking, especially at sunset – definitely one of the highlights.\n\nBut what truly made the night special was the bar – the cocktails were outstanding! Every drink was beautifully crafted and full of flavour.\n\nHuge compliments to the bartender Alex – not only were the cocktails delicious, but he was also incredibly friendly, professional and clearly passionate about his craft.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for great vibes, amazing views, and unforgettable drinks! 🌇🍸🌮",
