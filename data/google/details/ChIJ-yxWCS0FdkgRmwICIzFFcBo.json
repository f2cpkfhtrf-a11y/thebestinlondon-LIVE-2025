I give Gordon Ramsay Bar & Grill Mayfair two hands up.\n\nWe ordered the Beef Wellington along with side dishes like creamy spinach and a nice glass of wine. The Wellington was made with a rich mushroom duxelles and foie gras, wrapped in golden, flaky puff pastry. The beef itself was tender yet slightly crusty on the outside — such a perfect combination of textures and flavors.\n\nSince it’s a bar and we visited at lunchtime, I didn’t expect such a high-level experience, but I ended up with complete satisfaction. It was truly beyond my expectations, and I had a wonderful time here.",

Honestly I’m not sure what I expected (I feel like this is going to Olive Garden in Times Square and expecting it to be good) but I wanted to try a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.\n\nThe menu is super expensive. This was probably the most expensive meal we had in London while also being by far the worst. The sushi roll was terrible and was £20. I get better sushi from the hole in the wall places next to my apartment in NYC for 1/3 the price. The fish and chips (the main thing I wanted to try) was also not good - while the fish was flaky and clean tasting, it had no flavor. It was just bland and the tartar sauce wasn’t good. Not to mention the fries and peas which did not impress either. The bread and tomato salad were good.\n\nThe ambience is weird - there’s no sign/host stand and in order to enter the restaurant, you need to enter the other Gordon Ramsey restaurant next door and then enter this one through an unmarked side door. Very confusing and odd. Service was also very slow.",

The service was attentive and professional throughout — staff were friendly and made us feel welcome.\n\nWe ordered the signature Beef Wellington with wine pairing. The food itself was excellent — perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. However, the wine pairing experience was a bit underwhelming. The wines were served late and didn’t arrive in time with the courses, which took away from the overall experience slightly.\n\nThat said, the atmosphere was great, and the quality of the meal was definitely a highlight. Would still recommend, especially for a special occasion — just hoping they fine-tune the wine service to match the standard of the food.",
