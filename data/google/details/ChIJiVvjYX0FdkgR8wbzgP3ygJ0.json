The croquettes were visually beautiful and tasted amazing perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and flavourful inside.\n\nThe steak itself was incredible. It was cooked to absolute perfection and just melted in your mouth instantly. You could really taste the quality and care that went into preparing it.\n\nThe service was also excellent our waiter was so friendly and genuinely helpful with recommendations, which made the whole experience even better.\n\nThe only small suggestion I’d make is that the sharing steak plate could have been presented a bit more nicely in the pan along with the fries a little more visual finesse would have made it perfect.\n\nOverall, it was a fantastic meal with great food and service. I’d definitely come back!",

All the staff we encountered were fantastic and the service we received was amazing. They couldn't of done more for us to make sure we enjoyed our visit and they made my daughters birthday extra special. The food was incredible we had the set lunch menu 3 courses and it was fantastic value. We also ordered a few sides off the menu as well. The food was presented so lovely and the cocktail i had was incredible. We had the best lunch out here and highly recommend this fantastic restaurant. To all the wonderful staff who made our visit so lovely to the incredible food we enjoyed, we will definitely be back when we next visit London. Thankyou Gaucho Covent Garden",

We didn’t have a reservation, but the hostess was so kind and found us a table quickly — such a warm welcome!\n\nOur server, Alex, was fantastic — attentive, friendly, and made excellent recommendations. Every dish we tried was incredible, from the croquettes to the burrata to the absolutely delicious chicken dinner — all paired perfectly with great wine. Truly, chef’s kiss!\n\nA special shoutout to the manager, Ami, who was an absolute pleasure to speak with. We told her this was our favourite dinner of our trip, and she surprised us with a couple of glasses of Prosecco — such a thoughtful and memorable gesture.\n\nIf you're looking for amazing food, top-notch service, and a great ambience, I highly recommend Gaucho. You will not be disappointed. And if you're lucky, you’ll get to meet Alex and Ami — they truly made our evening unforgettable!",
