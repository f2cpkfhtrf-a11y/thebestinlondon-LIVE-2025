The place is huge and we were surprised at its size. The service was great - attentive, helpful and prompt (without feeling rushed). The cocktails were spot on and we did have quite a few - Tikki Tulum, Tokyo Trailblazer, Tropical Paloma and Pelino Jalapeño Margarita. We were disappointed that a couple of unique cocktails such as the bartender’s competition drink were not available (though they were on the menu). The best part was the food. The starters - asparagus yakiniku, chipotle calamari, truffle guacamole on crispy rice and shiitake, left us smacking our lips and craving for more. The main course was equally good - dynamite prawn and courgette dynamite tacos were yummy. To top off a great afternoon, our daughter was surprised with a complimentary birthday dessert and sake, which made her very happy. We will be back for more.",

      "text": "We visited Los Mochis London City and tried a selection of small plates alongside a couple of cocktails. I did however go with someone who unfortunately doesn't like seafood (so there's a lack of sushi in this review - but luckily Los Mochis caters for all).\n\nFor food, the chipotle calamari was good, though I’ve had better elsewhere. The chipotle mayo that came with it was delicious & smokey which made all the difference. The pato on crispy rice (duck) had a tasty batter but was quite heavy, making it tricky to eat with chopsticks but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The chutoro (medium fatty bluefin tuna) melted on my tongue. Both the shrimp tempura maki rolls and the dynamite prawn tacos were excellent, with the tacos easily my favourite dish of the night: sweet, spicy, and perfectly balanced.\n\nFor drinks, the Pepino Jalapeño cocktail was outstanding. Unlike similar versions I’ve had elsewhere, it was refreshing, light, and had just the right gentle kick. It was so good I had to order it again. The margarita was a safe but smooth classic.\n\nService was polite and attentive throughout. They are strict with table timings, and once our time was up, they kindly moved us over to the bar so we could continue our evening without feeling rushed.\n\nSomething I don’t usually review, but worth mentioning: the restrooms. They were impressive - clean, stylish, and with a refreshing yet relaxing ambiance. I love when a restaurant makes a statement with its facilities, and Los Mochis definitely delivered on that.\n\nOverall, Los Mochis offers a great mix of creative Japanese-Mexican dishes, fantastic cocktails, and stylish surroundings. A spot worth visiting, especially for the dynamite prawn tacos, Pepino Jalapeño cocktail, and yes, even the restrooms.",

They were able to accommodate us straight away and gave us a table next to the window.  We had a selection of dishes as it's small sharing plates paired with a few cocktails. We really enjoyed the food, really good quality and you could taste the different flavours in each dish. Very vibey with a house ambiance on a Friday night. Good for a high end London city date night.\nI highly rate the service, they were great at offering recommendations on drinks and dessert and I was able to charge my phone for a bit at the front desk. Also can't not mention a view of St Paul's in the distance.",

Our table was for 3pm which we thought wouldn’t be too busy but when we got there we were surprised to see lots of full tables! Despite the restaurant being busy, the team worked incredibly well to keep everything running smoothly and we didn’t have to wait for long to order or for our food to come out.\n\nAs soon as we tasted the food we understood why they were busy and for good reason. The food was incredible in both taste and texture and I almost couldn’t believe that it was 100% gluten free! As someone with coeliac it’s such a relief to find restaurants that are totally gluten free, especially when their food is also incredible. To top off the incredible dining experience we had, they brought out a free birthday dessert for my friend. All in all an amazing experience and I can’t wait to come back again.",
