      "text": "Yesterday my friend, her one-year-old daughter and I decided to try this restaurant after reading the very positive reviews. Unfortunately, our experience was extremely disappointing.\nFirst of all, it is presented as an Italian restaurant, but run by non-Italians. That already felt a bit unusual, but we decided to give it a chance anyway.\nWhen we entered, there was no greeting at all – just “Are you the one who asked for the high chair?” while pointing at a bar stool, not even a proper high chair. The restaurant itself is extremely small; we didn’t even know where to place the stroller.\nAfter sitting for more than 10–15 minutes, I had to get up myself to order because no one came to take it. The waiter, while setting our table, simply handed us things as if we were supposed to do it ourselves.\nWe ordered two gnocchi with seafood, focaccia and garlic bread as starters, and a simple pasta with tomato sauce for the baby. Instead of starters, the main dishes arrived first. To make things worse, the baby’s “simple pasta” came with pancetta and pepper – basically an amatriciana, which is completely inappropriate for a one-year-old.\nThe gnocchi had no flavour at all. My friend sent hers back, while I ate mine just to avoid wasting more time waiting for food. The seafood tasted of poor quality, and I ended up with stomach pain all evening.\nWe cancelled the focaccia and garlic bread, since starters should be served before the main course – not after. After the disappointing dishes, it didn’t feel worth spending more money there.\nHonestly, there was nothing authentically Italian about this place. The waiter mentioned the owner is Italian, but that doesn’t mean much if the staff in the kitchen and on the floor don’t know what they’re doing. The service was unfriendly, the food tasteless, and overall it was a terrible experience.\nWe will definitely not be returning.",

My partner pasta was better but it was definitely not worth 25£ a pasta with peas and mushroom.\n\nThe focaccia we had was nice indeed and the olives as well.\n\nThe reviews did look good that is why we went but I would definitely do not recommend and would not go back.",

I honestly could eat here every night and not get sick of the food. The staff were absolutely lovely but the night I was there (Monday) must have been unexpectedly busy as there was only one staff member on who was rushed off his feet with all the food and drink orders. He did a fantastic job but I think service would have been better with a couple more team members on board. It didn’t take away from the amazing meal though",
