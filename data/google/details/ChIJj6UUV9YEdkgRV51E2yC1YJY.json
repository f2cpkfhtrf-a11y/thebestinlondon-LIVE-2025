I have tried pretty much every place in London for afternoon tea so would say I know what I like and what's good value.\n\nThe staff as always were knowledgable, friendly and attentive.\n\nIn August, this is a great value for a new offering especially if you're new to trying out afternoon tea and don't want to fork out £100+ per person in London.\n\nLimited range of teas, which isn't a bad thing, sometimes having a long menu can be somewhat perplexing. They had the usual stars, Earl Grey, English Breakfast and Darjeeling etc. The only one that was missing for me was Assam.\n\nThe servings are generous - 5 finger sandwiches. The best one was the vadouvan chicken, the worst one was the rilletes de thon (tuna sandwich), which in my opinion has no place in afternoon tea!\nOf the patisserie the chocolate and peanut slice was the champion in this category, think a luxourious snickers. I could have easily eaten three of these.\n\nNow what really differentiates MF's afternoon tea from others is that instead of scones (my least favourite part) is that they serve two warm babkas which are superb. Soft like a cloud and served with homemade strawberry jam, hazelnut spread and clotted cream.\n\nHarry asked for my thoughts on the offering which I gave willingly.  I suggested they add their cabbage with achoiade in a petit pan instead of some of the finger sandwiches or a shot of the french onion soup.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit.",

I am always pleasantly surprised to be reminded of what proper hospitality can achieve.\n\nThe space is vast and high, but is really well planned out, so manages to feel intimate and private. Service was almost impeccable, especially from the younger staff members, who were all effortlessly and genuinely charming.\n\nHad the pate en croute, and was very pleased to be offered a little pot of mustard (that kept returning, refreshed as needed), a flatbread and then steak and cabbage. Prices vary, and I’m sure can rack up quite a bill, but there’s real value in there too. Had a cute mini martini and a couple of very pleasant glasses of wine.\n\nIt’s certainly one of the better meals I’ve had for a while, and whilst all the food was excellent it was really more the indefinable qualities of atmosphere and service that stood out the most. A proper, complete restaurant, and a total joy",
