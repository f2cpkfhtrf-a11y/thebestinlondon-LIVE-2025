Unfortunately, the dish was underwhelming. The vegetables—okra, fennel, aubergine, spring onion shoots—were fibrous, sparse, and didn’t add much to the plate. The curry sauce was overly thick and starchy, lacking balance. The portion of noodles was Over-generous almost turning it into a dish filler, but it felt mismatched with the meagre amount of vegetables.\n\nService left a lot to be desired. Food was handed over the counter without much interaction, and one of the waiters repeatedly brushed against me without a single apology. I eventually had to ask for the service charge to be removed.\n\nOverall, it was a disappointing visit. The food was below average, and its was overpriced and poor value. The lack of basic ingredients—especially vegetables, which are inexpensive—felt careless. I won’t be returning or recommending Koya.",

We waited at the entrance for few minutes, wondering what went wrong. They said we paid the correct amount but the waiter put it to the wrong table. So not our fault and we paid extra for some reasons (should be £72 but was asked £74). The one who paid extra was offered tea, but we were in a hurry so we declined. Thus low service rating. Maybe just one off.",

Miso soup rich and soothing.\nMy friend had the trout special and it was lacking a bit of flavour (he is japanese) but he did speak with the staff there and i hope his feedback will help the place elevate their authenticity. 😇\nAtmosphere is really nice to see the chefs at work and makes you even hungrier. 🤭",
