Meat is grilled inside with open kitchen viewing, so inside can get a little hot.\n\nExtensive drinks and cocktail menu, the cocktails are strong & tasty.\n\nEnvironment is really cosy, and great for couples, families, groups, etc\n\nFood was 10/10, no room for any issues whatsoever. The chicken, beef and lamb was exceptionally cooked, flavoursome and delicious.\n\nCondiments and accompaniments were spot on. Total feast for a foodie.\n\nStaff were so friendly, and welcoming.\n\nAnd to end the meal you are given complementary Bakalava, which although I was stuffed; tasted divine and finished the experience off to perfection.",

      "text": "Went there for dinner on a Monday evening with my wife and another couple.\n\nOnce we walked in, we were warmly greated by one of the chefs and then we went to the table where our friend was waiting for us.\n\nThe menus were already on the table, so we started thinking what we were going to have so by the time the last member of our group arrived, we could place the orders.\n\nWe started with a cold mix meze platter and 2 ayrans to drink. The flatbread that came with the platter was very nice and full of flavour as it had been warmed up on the grill where the meats were being done. On the platter there was a combination of yoghurt with spinach and herbs, hummus, olives, tabuleh and a few slices of cucumbers and tomatoes.\n\nAfter thoroughly enjoying that, it was the time for the main event: the Dem Jumbo meal platter. As we were 4 people, we originally asked if this would be enough and our host was quick to reassure us that it will be. We were definitely impressed with the size of the platter. It had chicken breast, wings and lamb on top, flatbread in the middle and rice and bulgur wheat as the base. Everything was incredibly flavoured and we actually had to take some of the food as takeaway as it was too much.\n\nAt the end, we ordered some Turkish tea and baclava. The tea was nice and hot, so it helped with the digestion, whereas the baclava's sweetness was welcomed after all the meat intake.\n\nThe service was very good and the host was kind enough to take off the baclava from the bill, a small gesture which we appreciated.\n\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant was nice and quiet up until 2 large groups came in. They were having a good time, but they could've been a bit more mindful about the other customers. This does not take anything from the great service we received.\n\nOverall a very nice experience, incredible food and we would love to come back again.",

      "text": "We recently dined at this delightful Turkish restaurant and had a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The meal began with a lovely touch: a complimentary salad, fresh and vibrant, accompanied by warm, fluffy bread and a variety of flavorful sauces that set the tone for the meal.\n\nI ordered the shish mixed chicken and lamb, which was a highlight—beautifully grilled, tender, and packed with smoky flavor. My partner opted for a lamb shish, which she found tasty but noted was somewhat tough in texture. We both agreed that the meats could have benefited from a touch more seasoning to elevate the flavors further, but this was a minor critique in an otherwise excellent meal.\n\nThe true star of the evening was the complimentary baklava offered at the end. It was absolutely amazing crisp, sweet, and perfectly layered with nuts and syrup, leaving us both smiling. Overall, the warm hospitality, generous extras, and quality of the food made for a very nice dining experience. We’d happily return!",
