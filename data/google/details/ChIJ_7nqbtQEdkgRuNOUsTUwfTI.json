      "text": "Gonna go out on a limb here and say this place is just not worth the likely 45min+ wait and elevated price level. Both for the food and the experience. Food wasn’t terrible, but just not what I expected after such a long wait and the amount of hype around it. All starters were fine, but even for someone who loves and eats a lot of spice, the (presumably) Thai chilies overpowered many dishes. Skewers had nice flavor but quite fatty. Unfortunately all meats were similar, including the rump- flavor itself was nice. The one great dish that I’d happily eat again is the clay pot noodles - truly delicious. 140£~ for two people.\n\nI think there’s a larger conversation to be had about the “reservation system” (non existent). While I can appreciate the no resi policy in a city where great restaurants are booked out in advance for months, I feel some adjustments are necessary. Not only are people waiting outside in droves, but they continue the “line” inside- the restaurant is incredibly cramped/small without people waiting for tables, but they cram people in behind the diners to keep the queue “shorter”. This makes the already loud environment even more hectic. That being said all staff was friendly, albeit understandably overwhelmed. If you can walk in without having to wait I think this is a fun place to try - just not if you have to stand around in the rain.",

We even got there early on Saturday to queue before opening, so we didn’t have to wait, which made the experience even better. The atmosphere is cozy and lively, and the smoky charcoal cooking adds a really unique depth to the dishes. I’ll definitely come back when I miss the taste of home.",

The vibe of the upstairs is great with the open kitchen and bar - we were offered to sit downstairs but waited for the upstairs because of the ambience. All of the upstairs seating is at a bar so it’s best for parties of 2.\n\nThe dishes were strong. Very pork heavy menu. The highlights were the pork loin (the best pork dish I’ve ever had), jowl (the first bites were better than the last, which were chewy), sticky rice, and crab glass noodles. I didn’t know pork could be so good and the loin completely blew me away with how tender and tasty it was. They say it can take up to 45 minutes to cook so I’d recommend ordering it as soon as you’re seated.\n\nService was great with all the staff being friendly and attentive. They just get the ambience right - you feel like you’re at a trendy restaurant when eating here.",

Had the steak, cod and chicken starters. Would definitely get those again as they were about £8-12 so I’d say decent value for good quality meat. Unfortunately the mains weren’t as good value as we got pad Thai which was £22 and for some reason the same size as a starter and didn’t even come with rice (had to order separately). I thought the spice was highest end of nice (which tbf is quite rare as often under spicey) however for Mel it was too spicey to the point she couldn’t really enjoy the texture or other flavours. The rice should’ve been illegal as SO clearly pre cooked and reheated but done so badly. Tiny portion too but not as bad as speedboat bar as only £2.50 not SIXXX for badly cooked rice. Still though badly cooked rice at a Thai restaurant (and such a renowned one) is unacceptable. I would come back if there was a ",

Their Tequila Ginger and Lime cocktail was delicious as well!!!! Wish I had 3 to 4 stomachs so could have more stuff here.
