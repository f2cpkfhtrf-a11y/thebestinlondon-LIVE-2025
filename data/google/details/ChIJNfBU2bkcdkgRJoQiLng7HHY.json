What this means, of course, is that you have to be intentional to eat here, and make a reservation. It is worth it.\n\nIt was a lovely day, so we ate outside under the pergola filled with ripening grapes. For starters, we had the cod roe dip with fresh baby radishes and absolutely delicious tomato salad topped with feta. The tomatoes were fresh and juicy, and it was just a lovely summer dish. For an entrees, one of us had the tuna with white beans. The fish was perfectly cooked, and the portion was substantial. The rest of us had two of the specials of the day. I had the crispy lamb ribs, which were quite an unusual preparation, but they were very tender and tasty. The wagyu beef entree was sensational. Perfectly cooked beef served with horseradish and some spicy greens. It was truly a lovely meal.\n\nThey have several cocktails plus a nice list of wines by the glass.\n\nThe staff is great, and the ambience very calm and beautiful. Beautiful. I highly recommend this lovely restaurant.",

Wine was excellent and service mostly good.\nOne waiter would just dump our plates on the table without talking us through the dishes. Maybe that's not their policy but it's a nice touch to be reminded of the elements.\nOtherwise, our main waitress was excellent.",

My main garnish was stone cold and the steak cooking instructions was not as requested.
