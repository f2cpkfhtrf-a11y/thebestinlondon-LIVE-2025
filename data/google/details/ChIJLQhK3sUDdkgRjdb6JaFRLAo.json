      "text": "A Night to Remember at Amazing Grace, London Bridge\n\nTucked away near the heart of London Bridge, Amazing Grace is unlike any restaurant or bar we’ve visited before. Housed in a breathtaking Grade II-listed 19th-century church, the venue effortlessly blends historic charm with vibrant modern energy. Think stained glass windows and original stone architecture meeting thumping disco beats and soulful live performances, it’s a unique sensory experience that grabs your attention the moment you step through the doors.\n\nWe visited on a Friday night, when the vibe was electric. The night’s soundtrack was built around disco, funk, soul, old-school hip-hop, and even some Garage classics, which were performed live with impressive vocals that got everyone moving. As we soaked in the lively atmosphere, we couldn’t help but admire how perfectly the lighting and acoustics complemented the stunning church setting; it's truly a party in a place you’d least expect.\n\nThe food was as memorable as the music. We kicked things off with the Amazing Grace Sharer, a generous and flavour-packed platter featuring crispy Japanese Fried Chicken, sticky-sweet Korean Chicken Wings, smoky Padron Peppers, juicy Corn Ribs, and moreish Korean Potato Bites. Each bite offered something bold, spicy, or savoury, a masterclass in Asian-inspired comfort food.\n\nWe followed this with a couple of Fried Chicken Baos, which were soft, fluffy, and bursting with flavour thanks to the tangy pickles, creamy Gochujang mayo, sesame, and spring onions. But the standout dish for us was the Chicken Burger. A free-range chicken coated in crunchy panko and sesame, layered with Kewpie mayo, fresh lettuce, and pickles. It’s rich, crispy, juicy, and a definite must-try. On the side, I ordered the Amazing Rice, which lived up to its name: a fragrant mix of spring onion and ginger oil, tare sauce, crispy onion, and sesame. It’s the kind of side you could happily eat on its own.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the Salted Caramel Brownie, served warm and delicately dusted with icing sugar. It was rich, gooey, and exactly the indulgent finale you want after a night of dancing and feasting. We also had a trio of Japanese Mochi Ice Cream—Mango, Chocolate, and Vanilla—which added a refreshing, chewy, and cool contrast to the brownie.\n\nAll chicken served here is halal, which made our meal worry-free and even more enjoyable. The mocktails were just as thoughtfully crafted as everything else. My wife had the Espresso Martini (alcohol-free), made with Amazing Grace’s house coffee mix and vanilla syrup; she called it one of the best she’s ever had. I loved my Grenadine Bramble, a bright, citrusy blend of Lyre’s Original, lime juice, sugar, and grenadine . It was refreshing, not overly sweet, and paired well with the food.\n\nA special mention goes to Dio, who looked after us throughout the evening. Friendly, attentive, and genuinely warm, he made us feel right at home, even in a venue buzzing with energy.\n\nBy the end of the night, we’d not only eaten incredibly well, but we’d danced, laughed, and soaked up one of the most unique dining experiences in London. If you’re looking for a place that hits all the right notes, food, vibes, and service , Amazing Grace London Bridge is the one. We can’t wait to return.",

I could understand if the restaurant was extremely busy and staff were under pressure, however it wasn’t. Food is ordered from the bar and when I went to order, the staff member wasn’t friendly and it seemed a chore for them to take my order. I feel like the atmosphere was let down by the customer service. Overall, I don’t think I would return unfortunately",

      "text": "I was out for First Fridays at the Tate Modern this month and a friend suggested we grab a drink at Amazing Grace afterwards. I wasn't totally sure what to expect, and while the walk over felt a bit longer than I anticipated, it ended up being so worth it.\n\nThere was a modest £5 cover, which honestly felt like a steal once we got inside. The energy in the room was electric! The live performers were phenomenal—seriously, the kind of voices that make you stop mid-sentence just to soak it all in. The upstairs lounge had a great vibe, and the dancefloor was already buzzing... and it was only around 10:15pm!\n\nI spotted a few people still enjoying food, but unfortunately the kitchen had just closed by the time we arrived. Not a huge deal—just means I’ll definitely be back to give the menu a proper try. Between the music, the drinks, and the atmosphere, Amazing Grace has officially earned a spot on my regular date night list.\n\nIf you’re in the area and looking for something fun, lively, and a little unexpected—this place is it.",
