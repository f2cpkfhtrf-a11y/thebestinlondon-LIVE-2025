I stood at the front of the restaurant and waited for a while, even though there was a lady cleaning a table infront of me and the place had lots of spare seats. I had to ask her if I could sit down, and she wasn't too friendly either.\n\nOnto the food, I had burger, chips and squid.\nAll of the food was delicious, hot and flavoursome. The food didn't takelong to come out.\nThe service was disappointing and then to be hit with a service charge was a kick in the teeth. Hence the 3 star review.\nCustomer service is huge, definitely needs looking at.",

Coleslaw was tasty. Sweet potato fries were lovely a crispy. I had the Mexican chicken burger, was really good.\nMy friend had beef burger, which he said was good.\nWe did order too much food, but you can take leftovers home!",
