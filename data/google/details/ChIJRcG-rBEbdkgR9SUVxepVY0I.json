The Mozzarella Bites were the best I've ever had, as a vegetarian they were able to accommodate doing it not on top of the Nduja sauce and keeping it on the side. It had a good amount of Mozzarella and the hot honey twist was incredible. The pizza tasted New York style with a crispy base and a good amount of sauce on the pizza. We celebrated a birthday and the staff were incredible in assisting with candles, plates for a cake that was bought in from outside. I highly recommend and will be going back.",

We had the mozzarella sticks (recommend to share this as the portion is very generous) and I regret not filming a cheese pull because these things kept going! I had the lamb ragu and it was incredibly tender, very well portioned and tasty! We finished by sharing a cheesecake (also recommended as the portion was generous!), tasted so fresh with a very subtle hint of lemon and not too sweet.\n\nWe came to celebrate my graduation and the staff made the effort to congratulate me and put little candles in the cheesecake which was a lovely touch.\n\nAbsolutely will be coming here again!",
