I don't have any food allergies, but sometimes I do have preferences. To be able to present a tasting menu with flexibility and options was something I felt more amazing about the chef's menu design. My favourite was the pigeon, and I was so happy to see that the chef took on the challenge to turn the pigeon leg into a piece of fine \"finger\" food.\n\nIngredients were top-notch. Culinary skills were clearly showcased. Menu cleverly designed. Options available to suit any appetite. Comfy dining environment. Happy stomach, happy me.",

It's not often when I have no constructive feedback for a team, but I'm very comfortable in stating this was as perfect an experience as is humanly possible.\n\nArriving just a few minutes earlier than my reservation, I was the first guest to arrive for dinner. While oftentimes this is an opportunity for one to witness last-minute preparations - not at caractère - the team was ready.\n\nGreeted warmly and shown to a corner table that overlooked the entire comfortable space that feels more homey than commercial, I was able to observe the entire orchestra of service perform their beautiful symphony of caring for their guests. Opting for the tasting menu, and adding their focus special that included seasonally fresh black truffle, the sommelier asked about my choice for wine - I opted to leave it to him for pairing each of the 6 courses. This one decision proved to be wise.\n\nThe details are seen in the included pictures: generous portions, insanely creative presentations of each plate, attention to detail of adornments, exquisite timing (6 courses = 3 hours).\n\nAnd the wine... provocative and foundational selections. Sensory perfection. Each was offered with a level of education, reasoning and pairing decision-making.\n\nOne star? I would offer there is some room for recognition improvement...",
