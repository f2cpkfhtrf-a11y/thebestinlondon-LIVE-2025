My friend ordered the prawn Thai Green Curry and declared it the best she’s ever had and for someone who always orders Thai Green Curry- that’s saying something!\n\nI went with the Vegetable Rice Noodle in brown soy sauce it was perfection.\n\nFor starters, we had the Fried Tofu and the Garlic Okra, both of which were excellent.\n\nWe’re already looking forward to coming back and trying more dishes!",

The decor is tasteful and the furniture is comfortable.\n\nThe food is amazing, 10/10. Myself and a friend ordered 2 starters (sweetcorn fritters and vegetable spring rolls). They came out piping hot and tasted extremely fresh in the best way. For mains, 1 got the pad thai (really good, the chick was great and the noodles and veg really pulled it together so well. loved the addition option that allowed to add peanut pieces at my own pace). Second main was the chicken masseman and egg noodles (the chicken came over lit candles which allowed it to stay hot the whole\nmeal and as someone who doesn't always enjoy rice, the noodles were an excellent accompaniment). The portion sizes are really good too.\n\nFor drinks, lychee martini and mock tail lychee drink. They were both really tasty.\n\nNo complaints on this meal at all, will be back again for sure.",

The thin noodles are perfectly chewy, the broth is rich and comforting, and the meats are spot on. On top of that, the crispy pork crackling is addictive, the crispy prawn dumplings and fried tofu are amazing, and the longan drink with chunky fruit is the perfect finish.

The bathrooms are cleaner and hygienic. And the food,….my goodness…the food. I had the lamb with coconut rice. Let me start with how quickly they came out with the food. I was expecting to stay longer than I did waiting. The presentation was very good, my appetite rose exponentially on merely sighting the food.\n\nWhen I dug in, the experience was much more exhilarating! The rice was perfectly done, the grains well cooked that they just rolled off your tongue into your throat! The curry sauce….awwww. Every single spice was alive in that sauce. It has a distinct sweet taste that went straight to your brain, bursting open sacks of serotonin and dopamine.\n\nAnd lastly came the lamb itself, so succulent, it was like a being extending its hands to you to be lifted off its bone.",
