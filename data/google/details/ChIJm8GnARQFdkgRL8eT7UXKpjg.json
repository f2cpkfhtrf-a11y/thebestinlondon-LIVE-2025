When arriving, the other host was ready to lead us to the table. Great start.\nThe waiter serving us was on training I believe, and he was very attentive and nice. Also, the person who seemed to be the manager was very attentive and present on the floor.\nThe down was the food - firstly they didn’t have oysters which I was craving for but fine, I had a great cauliflower soup. However, the roast itself, although the veggies were good, the chicken was pretty dry. Additionally, we had the chocolate fondant which was pretty bland.\nI was also slightly disappointed as I expected a special touch, maybe a candle or a happy birthday platter (anything really) as we had mentioned we were celebrating my birthday - which was nicely acknowledged on our arrival, by the host downstairs - but I guess that’s not the type of thing they do there (?)",

The fettuccine with the addition of what my companion thought would be whole prawns as the menu  stated grilled prawns turned out to be the addition of 8 tasteless peeled prawns. He would rather have had 3 whole grilled prawns than 8 tasteless ones for the additional £5 charge. The wagyu burger was small which was fine for me but some may find the portion size lacking. Presentation wise it sat very alone on its large plate with no garnish. The ‘triple’ cooked chips arrived anaemic looking and in need of further cooking to bring them up to what was promised. This was dealt with apologetically and promptly with a good outcome ie. delicious triple cooked chips. The green salad instead of being refreshing and crisp was as over dressed as Danny La Rue ….sodden.\nThree glasses of wine and the bill came to £133….perhaps just a drink next time.",

The staff were consistently friendly, attentive, and helpful, greeting us at the door with warm smiles and welcoming faces. The seating was comfortable, and the ambiance exuded a chic and modern vibe, complemented by ample space throughout the restaurant. The restrooms were immaculate, and the food lived up to the overall high standards.\n\nIf you plan to order the steak for two, I highly recommend starting with some starters, as the 600g may leave you wanting more if you are hungry. On a sweet note, the sticky toffee pudding was one of the best I’ve enjoyed in a long time it was perfectly moist and flavourful, resembling a loaf. (The plant based mains option though could be better).\n\nOverall, it is a top choice for a memorable dining experience and great for\nA date night.",
