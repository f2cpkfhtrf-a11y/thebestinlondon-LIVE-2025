Any restaurant would be lucky to have him run and represent them.\n\nHighly recommend and can’t wait to return!",

The very first bite stopped me in my tracks. The meat was so tender it practically slipped off the bone, no effort needed, just pure melt-in-the-mouth perfection.\n\nThe flavor balance was unreal just the right hint of smokiness, kissed with a touch of sweetness, rounded off with the perfect level of spice that warmed rather than overpowered. It was comfort and elegance in the same mouthful.\n\nEvery bite felt emotional, like revisiting a place and time that only food this soulful can unlock. It wasn’t just dinner it was memory, tradition, and craftsmanship served on a plate. Hands down, the best lamb shank I have ever had in my life.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just the food. The staff were incredible. We actually booked the café by mistake instead of the restaurant, but instead of turning us away, they went out of their way to look after us. They even brought the lamb shank over from the restaurant to the café  going that extra mile that you don’t see often anymore.",

The olovieh could have used a bit more spice but was tasty - while the kuku took me back to childhood memories eating with my family around the table. It had pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top which added a nice contrast. The Taftoon bread and Torshi were nice complements to the appetizers and the rest of the meal.\n\nThe true standouts from our order were the mains. For the table we shared a Vaziri - which is one skewer of Joujeh Kabob (Boneless Chicken) and one skewer of Koobideh Kabob (Ground Lamb).  The Koobideh was grilled to perfection while the Joujeh was extremely tender and moist.\n\nThe Ghormeh Sabzi (Mixed Herb Stew) was one of the best I’ve had in a restaurant. You could immediately taste the dried lime doing its part to blend and mix the flavors. More times than not, when ordering this dish at a Persian restaurant, it is not fresh - however this was very fresh and comforting to eat.\n\nAt this point we were very full - yet still decided to order the desert “Se-Shir Irani” which translates to “Iranian Tres Leches.” Unfortunately, they had just sold out for the night - which was disappointing but left us something to look forward to next time.\n\nThe food, staff, space, and ambiance were all very welcoming! It will be a regular stop for me next time I’m in London.",
