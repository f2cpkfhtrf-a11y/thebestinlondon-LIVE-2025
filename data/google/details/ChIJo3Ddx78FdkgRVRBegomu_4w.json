Our favourite was the beef. The sauces that went with them were delicious too.\n\nThe lamb chops were also amazing, they were thick and cooked and marinated to perfection.\n\nWe also got the ribeye dry red chilli, which was like a curry and stir fry and wow…probably some of the best saucy style beef I’ve tried. Cooked to perfection. Juicy, tender and melt in the mouth.\n\nThe Bombay chilli prawns were also amazing we ate that with the egg Szechuan fried rice. Everything was spiced to perfection, if you can’t hack chilli then maybe asked for a milder flavour. If you’re used to chillier food then it’s perfect. Probably a Nando’s level hot - extra hot as a comparison.\n\nWe also got a bing bread I think this was like a laccha paratha. This was so delicious you could taste the ghee and the crispy layers. I would happily eat this with some desi tea.\n\nThe most underwhelming item was the lollipop chicken and the sauce was just OK but it was still very fresh and delicious.\n\nWe also got the sizzling brownie and wow this was sooo delicious, with it being on a skillet the bottom of the brownie gets slightly chewy. It was just a perfect dessert simple but 10/10.\n\nThe service was also 10/10 alongside\nthe ambience and experience. The place had a calm and chill vibe. Even though it was extremely busy. The waiters and the managers carefully tended to all tables smoothly it was literally jammed from 5pm. You can tell the staff enjoy working there as they just vibe together.\n\nI would definitely go again very soon to try the items I didn’t get to try.\n\nThank you!\n\nBTW it’s like a 40 minute walk  from KGX.",

Lots of what I ate was very tasty but we had a very long wait for our food and the waiter, unfortunately, told me a meat dish was vegan so I accidentally ate beef. Flavours could have been even punchier and the meal was expensive for what it was. All in all I had a fun time but wouldn’t rush to return.",

Crackling spinach...how do they get the spinach so wonderfully crackling, light, and airy!?!? Popcorn cauliflower 😋 could be an all day everyday snack. The noodles with chicken added in was an amalgamation of spices with a tinge of heat was so very tasty.\n\nGood, attentive service.
