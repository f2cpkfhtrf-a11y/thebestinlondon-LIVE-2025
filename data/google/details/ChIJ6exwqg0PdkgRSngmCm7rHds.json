Which were a carbonara and an amatricana which both were very good and made with homemade pasta and guanciale. Also the carbonara was made the traditional way, without any cream AND it's the cheapest restaurant around Notting hill. Every other restaurant here charges 22+£ for carbonaras with cream. After we got a dessert and drinks as well, a tiramisu al pistacchio and two limoncellos, which were fantastic too. The waiters were helpful and kind. Accidentally we were handed the wrong table's bill, but it was handled professionally and kindly.\nBy the way, we got our food in less than 10 minutes.",

We visited last night a group of 3 people - and for starters we tried their tender beef meatballs, crispy rice balls similar to Arancini and deep fried squid , all very delicious and fresh. Pasta carbonara as a main was a trip back to Italy, such a delicious al dente & fresh egg pasta! Delicious fresh pizzas as well! My only regret was feeling too full at the end of the meals and not having enough space to try their sweet treats as well - a good reason to come back to this beautiful restaurant! Would definitely recommend it, staff were friendly and cheerful and they know how to make you feel transported back to an Italian holiday 🍕🇮🇹🍝!",

The highlight of my meal was the Carbonara—without a doubt, the best I’ve ever had! Perfectly creamy, rich, and made the traditional way without cream, just how it should be. The pasta was cooked to perfection, and the balance of flavors was outstanding.\n\nThe rest of the menu offers equally delicious options, with fresh ingredients and excellent presentation. Service was attentive, though slightly slow at peak hours. Overall, an incredible dining experience. Can’t wait to return!",
