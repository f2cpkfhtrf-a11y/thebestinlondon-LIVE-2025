The reception staff was friendly and welcoming, and Agnes delivered great customer service, particularly when checking on me to ensure the meal was satisfactory. The food was well presented and flavorful, and the doughnut dessert was outstanding. I went for the Samurai Dinner set Menu. The ambience and decor were impressive, and the toilets were impeccably clean with a pleasant scent.\n\nHowever, the stall seating I was assigned near the kitchen felt cramped, and as a solo diner, I was told tables were mostly reserved for two, which would have been best not mentioning for a first time visitor. Table clearing and dish changes were slow at times, and I noticed inconsistent hygiene among the chefs where one wore gloves, but the other didn’t. Despite these slight drawbacks, I’d return and highly recommend The Ivy Asia for its vibrant atmosphere, tasty offerings and good service overall.",

The moment you step inside, you’re captivated by the stunning and vibrant Asian-inspired décor — from the glowing floors to the elegant lighting and artistic details throughout the space.\n\nAlthough the restaurant was quite busy when we arrived, we managed to get a table without a long wait, which reflects great organization and efficient hosting. The atmosphere inside was energetic and lively — perfect for a memorable dinner with friends or family.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious. Every dish we tried was well-prepared, flavorful, and made with fresh ingredients. The service was outstanding, and the staff were incredibly friendly, offering suggestions and checking in with genuine warmth.\n\nThe prices were very reasonable considering the quality of the food, ambiance, and location. It felt like a complete experience where every detail was thoughtfully executed.\n\nI’ll definitely come back again on my next visit to London. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a refined and vibrant Asian dining experience in the heart of Chelsea.",

I celebrated my birthday there for reservation for 2, we waited 15 minutes to be seated but we were able to enjoy drinks at the bar. The restaurant offers two types of food menus: Set menu - appetiser, starter, main and dessert at an extra cost of £5. As well as single food item orders with a wide selection of appetisers, small plates, large plates and sharing plates etc. The food, drinks and atmosphere was fantastic! However, our waitress Andrea could improve on her customer service mannerisms to ensure all guests have an equal welcoming experience!",

While the presentation was impeccable, the portions were rather small and didn’t justify the price. I wouldn’t recommend this option if you have a big appetite.
