Each dish was cleanly presented with good ingredients allowed to shine — from the light starters to the perfectly cooked fish and thoughtful desserts. A refined lunch that balances comfort and finesse.",

Our food was sublime (shellfish cocktail, asparagus; whole rabbit for two; souffle and ice-creams), each dish was technically excellent, tasted amazing but also generously portioned. The sommelier's suggested wine pairings were lovely and didn't take advantage in terms of price per glass. We can't fault the evening.",
