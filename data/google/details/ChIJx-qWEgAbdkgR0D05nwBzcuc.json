Stopped for breakfast and was told at entry they had no coffee ( it was ok but glad they let us know at 9:30 am lol) but we confirmed when we entered they had bloody Mary’s so excellent.  We ordered bloody Mary’s and a few toast plasters and grilled cheese only to be told they weren’t serving alcohol until 10am (yet I confirmed on their breakfast menu which stated it was 8am to 11:15am. After a bit we were told they would make them for us. Ok great. I really struggled between the vanilla pancakes and the avocado toast with egg and opted for the eggs.   Which were delicious.  But I’m craving the pancakes still especially after seeing them delivered to a neighboring table lol.  Food was delish. The spouts and crispy chickpeas on top of the smashed avocado was yum and the eggs are great.  The grill cheese was very well done.",

The beans portion is smaller than I recall from previous times I’ve had it. The biggest disappointment is half a slice of halloumi cheese for £3. It look forlorn and hardly is a reasonable portion. Gross margins on food of 55% is about standard. This is way off mark.\nLovely food but I’m getting disappointed with the experience with Caravan these days.",
