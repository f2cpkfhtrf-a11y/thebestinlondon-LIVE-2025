      "text": "FONDA is an upscale, modern Mexican restaurant that specializes in what I would call classics with a twist.\n\nThe menu is designed so that each guest should order 3-4 plates and share. It’s a great way to sample many menu items.\n\nWe ordered as instructed by the very knowledgeable server and were blown way by the quality and flavor combinations of every dish!\n\nWe washed everything down with Fonda Margaritas.\n\nThe only drawback is that FONDA is not just expensive it is VERY expensive, socially considering this is Mexican cuisine.\n\nI love Mexican and am willing to pay for great food. (Which I did). I did not expect to walk about paying £428 for 4 people.\n\nWould I go back? Yes, because it was that delicious. I would focus more on the larger mains and less on the small tapas plates that require multiple orders per item to feed the table so they add up quickly!!\nExample: £10 for a small plate but then the server advises we order 1 plate per customer so that one “starter” alone was £40.\n\nSecond time dining out this week where an automatic 15% gratuity was added to the bill.\n\nThis is becoming more and more common here. It’s too bad. There was always something refreshing about the 10-12% gratuity cap. Feeling more like the US these days.",

The staff were so genuinely passionate about their food and felt so proud to share it - I can see why though it was fantastic. Never did I think I would enjoy a pumpkin seed dip but it was one of the best things I’ve eaten. I can’t wait to go back (hopefully the cheesecake will be back on the menu by then!!!)",

The location itself is beautiful — stylish and welcoming, with a lovely atmosphere that made us feel comfortable and relaxed right away.\n\nThe staff were incredibly kind and attentive from the moment we arrived. Their warm hospitality and willingness to help with recommendations really stood out and added a personal touch to our meal.\n\nAs for the food — it was simply outstanding. We ordered a variety of dishes to get a good sense of the menu, and every single one exceeded our expectations. Each plate was not only visually appealing but packed with flavor and clearly prepared with high-quality ingredients. It’s clear that the chefs at Fonda take great pride in their work.\n\nOverall, it was a wonderful dining experience. Great location, amazing food, and exceptional service — we couldn’t have asked for more. We’re already looking forward to our next visit!",

The decor is lovely, and the music creates a pleasant atmosphere without making conversation difficult. Most importantly, the service was perfect. Every staff member we spoke to was friendly and gave great explanations for each dish. The service charge is higher than usual (15%), but it’s well deserved. Fonda, thank you for a wonderful evening—I will definitely be back!",
