The waiter said they make their own pecking duck pancake, we received factory made pancake .\n\nI can taste the Honey roast pork char siu was frozen and reheat by microwave, It was dry and chewy.\n\n£75 for a Lobster tails laid in giant lobster shell with the almost 70% butter I could not taste any lobster meat at all.\n\nFor Dim sum we have scallop and prawn har gao, it might be handmade but it usually comes with big pieces of scallop i guess I got a newborn. Har gao should be at least few pieces, we got some in finely chop.\n\nIt was a treat from my friend so I have to be polite and not to complaint . For the same price we paying in central london you can get much better quality and services.\n\nFried rice with xo sauce was nice not greasy but xo sauce should have dry scallop and spiciness.\n\nNoodles with mushroom is slightly salty but it is the most decent food of that meal.\n\nThe waiters aren’t seem to know what are they serving and the ingredients. Foods aren’t serve as what we being told.\n\nI was with a group of friends for a special event so I have to be polite and nice on that day.",

We chose House of Ming as we had heard good things about it, on arrival we were greeted warmly and showed to a lovely booth with curtains. Staff were attentive and the food was really nice, especially as we were vegetarian for that period, it was Navratri and we don't go vegetarian for the nine days. My husband (who isn't vegetarian normally) was also very impressed and as he's also a very good chef it's a huge relief when he finds the food excellent. We were given complimentary cocktails and a beautiful dessert in honour of our anniversary. Thank you to B. Prasad and everyone who works for House of Ming for making our evening extra special.",

Each appetizer was a testament to the kitchen's mastery of Chinese cuisine.\nFor our mains, the Hakka Noodles were cooked to perfection, the Chilli Oyster Fish was rich and satisfying, and the Veg Fried Rice was a delightful accompaniment. The delectable flavours of each dish were truly memorable.\nA special mention must go to Dexter, whose warm welcome and attentive service made our lunch even more enjoyable. His care and professionalism ensured we had a truly wonderful time. We can't wait to return to House of Ming for another incredible meal!",
