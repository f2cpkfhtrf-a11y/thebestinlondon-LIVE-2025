The shisha was pretty standard, even though we went for a premium flavourâ€”and at Â£45 it felt quite pricey for what it was.\n\nWe also ordered 3 starters, 2 drinks (hot chocolate + latte) and a pitcher jug, and the bill came to over Â£100, which felt super expensive considering we didnâ€™t get that much. On top of that, they only accept cash, which was a bit annoying. Service was okay, nothing special, but overall the vibe of the place was nice ðŸ˜Š",

Would highly recommend.\n\nIâ€™ve lost count of how many times Iâ€™ve been here over the years, with groups of 2 to 10+, and it has always been consistently good. Went here the other day on a lovely, warm, sunny day and sat in the outdoor area - felt like I was enjoying an al-fresco dining experience abroad. Lovely relaxed atmosphere.\n\nMassive portions and the food is full of flavour and the meat/ chicken was tender and moist and always cooked to perfection and the chilli sauce is amazing. The kunefa is the show stopper though, and probably better than those Iâ€™ve had in Istanbul - thereâ€™s not many Turkish restaurants that sell it so I was so glad to find out that they do a few years ago - is the main reason I come here tbh - itâ€™s cooked fresh and not heated up out of a box, itâ€™s just the perfect dessert to end the meal.\n\nStaff are friendly and polite and the service is excellent. Reasonably priced for what youâ€™re getting compared to other places in a prime location.",
