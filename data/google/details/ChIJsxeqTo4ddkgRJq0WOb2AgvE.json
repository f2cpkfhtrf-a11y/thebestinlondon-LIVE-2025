The current Head Chef is Taz Sarhane Known for his innovative approach to modern British cuisine. He has developed a passion for ingredient preservation techniques like fermenting and dry-aging.\nThe menu format is tasting menu only of ten courses, with just 15 customers at capacity in total. They source British ingredients.\nThe design space is intimate with details include wooden panelling.",

      "text": "We had high expectations for Cycene when we chose it to celebrate our anniversary, but unfortunately, our visit was marred by poor hospitality, lack of communication, and an unreasonably rigid approach to service. While some members of the team were professional and attentive, others, especially the chef Taz Sarhane, seemed inexperienced and bad-tempered, which further contributed to a frustrating evening.\n\nWe arrived 20 minutes late due to heavy rain and traffic, but as a courtesy, we tried calling the restaurant three times, 30 minutes before our reservation, with no response. Upon arrival, instead of any form of acknowledgment or explanation, we were immediately escorted upstairs to our table. While the service on the ground-floor bar was just about to start with two empty seats, clearly ours. Only after sitting down did we realize that we had completely missed the initial experience at the ground-floor bar, which was supposed to include bread, broth and a course with A5 Wagyu and Caviar. No one mentioned this to us, and we had to ask three different staff members before finally getting a response. It was only after repeatedly bringing it up that the chef himself came to speak with us—but instead of addressing our concerns professionally, he was dismissive, defensive, and outright rude.\n\nRather than showing even the slightest empathy, the chef repeatedly emphasized his strict timing policy, stating that he did not want to keep later guests waiting because of our delay. However, there were clearly two empty seats at the bar, and we were the last guests of the night, making his argument feel completely unjustified. When we expressed our disappointment at how the situation had been handled, he became visibly irritated and told us we could leave if we were unhappy—a shocking level of hostility from a Michelin-starred establishment. Throughout the conversation, he kept bringing up the restaurant’s Michelin status, as if to look down on us rather than addressing the issue professionally.\n\nThe food itself was underwhelming. While we could see that the kitchen was attempting to incorporate Nordic-style fermentation techniques, the execution felt forced and unbalanced, lacking the refinement and harmony that this approach requires. Some flavors were overly intense and clashed rather than complementing each other, resulting in a mediocre and forgettable dining experience. Compared to the many Michelin-starred restaurants we have visited around the world, the food here simply did not stand out. To make matters worse, when the chef finally offered a “compensation” for the missed experience, all we received was bread—something that should have been served to us without needing to ask.\n\nDespite the chef’s unprofessional behavior, we must acknowledge that some members of the staff were polite and attentive. Fine dining is not just about food; it is about hospitality, attention to detail, and the ability to create a seamless experience for guests. This restaurant failed in all these aspects, and given the dismissive attitude from leadership, we cannot recommend it.\n\nLondon is one of the most diverse cities in the world and home to an incredibly rich dining scene. It is also where we live and work, and we find it unacceptable that the chef’s unreasonable attitude is allowed to tarnish the experience of those who come to Cycene with high expectations, eager to explore the avant-garde dining concept at Blue Mountain School. During our conversation, the chef insisted that he prepares over 100 dishes a day for different guests and therefore cannot make compromises for anyone. But isn’t ensuring a great experience for every guest exactly what every hospitality professional should strive for?\n\nThere are far better Michelin-starred restaurants that value their guests and execute their vision with skill and grace—this is not one of them.",
