The food presentation was impressive, and overall the dishes looked great.\n\nI ordered the arroz de mariscos, which I’d rate 3.5/5. I found it a little salty at first, but after squeezing the lime on it, the flavour balanced out nicely and became much more enjoyable. They also served these small potatoes that were absolutely delicious.\n\nIn my experience, JOIA is a beautiful spot with top notch service, a welcoming atmosphere and lovely food. I would visit again. ❤️",

The food was amazing, with authentic Portuguese flavors and a stunning view of Battersea Park and the Power Station. We highly recommend the octopus—it's fantastic!

We had to find staff to allow us to get up there as we were pressing the buttons and it didn’t seem like it was working. But maybe it was just a “us” thing!\nWe arrived at the restaurant and we were greeted warmly by the staff and the atmosphere was brilliant. Service was flawless and the food was excellent.\nMust say that I drank London Essence for the first time (White peach & jasmine flavour) and this is now my favourite drink ever!\nAdditionally, this was a meal out to celebrate my partner’s birthday and according to my note left on the booking form, they presented him a cake at the end with a happy birthday note. Really thoughtful gesture and the cake was brilliant. Definitely coming back.",
