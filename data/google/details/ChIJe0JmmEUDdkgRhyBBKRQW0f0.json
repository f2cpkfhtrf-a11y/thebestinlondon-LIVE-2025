The moment we walked through the doors, we knew this would be an authentic Indian experience. Hussain (manager) and Monica (waitress) went above and beyond to deliver an exceptional service. They were attentive, very knowledgeable about the food and helpful. The dishes served were 10/10 and the portion sizes were perfect. I would highly x 2 recommend this restaurant for a date night, meet-up,  a group gathering or any occasion. This place delivered and the chefs done good!",
