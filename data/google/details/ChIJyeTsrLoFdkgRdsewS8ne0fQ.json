Definitely the best mint sauce I have ever had.\nThe service was amazing.\nI would recommend the All In Sunday roast with a Beefy Mary.\nI love it when a restaurant does what it should right (serve great food) without pretentiousness.\nThe apple crumble and white chocolate cheesecake were excellent conclusions to a lovely roast.\nThe atmosphere could be a bit less noisy, but to be fair, that is just my preference and some people might consider that good vibes of a busy restaurant.",

This was busy and the atmosphere was buzzing. Service was excellent. I went for the 300g fillet and it was good ... very good! Had the crayfish salad for starter and was surprised at how good that was ... the avocado in the base salad is sublime. I did see the beef ribs starters coming out though and admit to some food envy but cannot complain as the crayfish salad was good and quite light before tucking into the steak main. I had the low alcohol beer served in an iced beer glass - nice!. Next time I'm going for the porterhouse! Will definitely be going back to this place and cannot recommend it enough. Superb.",

The Denver was nice but a tad chewy, however the chips and the bone marrow was lovely and would highly recommend.\n\nWe ordered dessert and got the cheesecake and crumble. Would recommend as well.\n\nHad a very good experience at the restaurant but we were made unaware that the restaurant needed the table back at a certain time and it was towards the end of the meal that the host told us that they needed the table back asap which surprised us as we were not told at the beginning and were still waiting on our dessert.",

The crispy pork crackling was a standout, and the vegetables were roasted beautifully. The giant Yorkshire pudding soaked in rich gravy was absolutely divine.\n\nFor dessert, we had the apple crumble with hot custard – comforting, warm, and exactly what we wanted to end the meal.\n\nThe atmosphere was vibrant and cosy, service was lovely, and the place was packed – so definitely book in advance to avoid missing out.\n\nIt had everything we love about a classic British Sunday Roast, done to perfection. Highly recommended!",

It is definitely a busy place but considering how busy went very smoothly .\n\nWe went with the recommended \"all in\" but kind of wished I had not.\n\nDon't get me wrong it was delicious but the bulk was 1 large pork chop which though delicious had a massive chunk that was all fat.\n\nYou then got a smallish sized lamb chop and a very small serving of steak.\n\nIt did however come with 3 crackers with different toppings each and 1 side each.\n\nNext time I would probably just pick a separate meat from the menu then build around it.\n\nI also ordered the bone marrow which I had never tried before and that was tasty.\n\nAll in all I do recommend however",
