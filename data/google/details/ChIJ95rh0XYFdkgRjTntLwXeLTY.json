Our food was perfectly prepared(very flavorful, nice ingredient combinations), had nice textures, and was nicely plated.\n\nI ordered the green tofu salad with southern fried plant chick+n. It was very fresh. The sugar-snap peas added a pleasant crunch to the salad and the avocado dressing was very flavorful and refreshing. The marinated tofu was flavorful as well. The portion size was perfect.\n\nMy friends ordered the ale mushroom pot pie, the kimchi bokkeumbap, and tofu green salad. Our table shared the turmeric carrot humus, pita/paratha and lemon pepper fries.\n\nEven as the restaurant started to fill up we were able to have conversations in normal speaking tones.\n\nMildreds Victoria will definitely be one of my go to restaurants whenever I’m in London.",

The staff were friendly and accommodating, the food was generally good and reasonably priced. My friend ordered the kimchi rice, tofu dish, which I tried and wished I'd ordered myself. I had  a veggie burrito dish, which wasn't as flavoursome or exciting as the rice in my opinion. However, we both absolutely loved the pistachio cheesecake. Overall a wonderful dining experience and we will definitely visit again soon.",

I ordered the mushroom ale pot pie and although it looked fab, it did end up becoming  extremely messy so didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. The pastry was just placed on the mushroom pie so went all over my clothes when I tried cutting into it.\nI did end up having to move the pastry onto a separate plate and eating the mushrooms separate and the pastry part separate.",
