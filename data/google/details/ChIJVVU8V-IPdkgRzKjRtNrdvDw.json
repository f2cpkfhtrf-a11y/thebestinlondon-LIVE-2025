From the moment I stepped through the door, I was enveloped in an atmosphere of elegance and warmth.\n\nThe culinary experience was nothing short of extraordinary; each dish was a masterpiece, beautifully presented and bursting with flavor.\n\nAs a fully vegetarian diner, I was thrilled to discover the creativity and thoughtfulness that went into my meal. The vegetarian options were not only diverse but also innovative, showcasing the chef's ability to elevate plant-based ingredients to new heights. Each dish was a delightful symphony of flavors, with vibrant colors and textures that made every bite a joy. I especially loved the potato dish!\n\nThe staff at Core were exceptionally friendly and personable, making me feel welcomed and valued throughout my visit.\n\nIn summary, Core by Clare is a remarkable dining destination that combines exquisite food, attentive service, and a welcoming atmosphere. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a memorable culinary adventure.",

Clare was there overseeing each dish that left the kitchen.  The service was exceptional, fast, professional but unobtrusive.  The food presentation was imaginative and beautiful. We had the Classic taster menu, from which my froends substituted a couple of dishes. That was a great and flexible service.\nThe food was an explosion of various tastes and colour. The menu was new reflecting the seasonal changes with produce from local farms.\nAlthough the portions looked small, I was full long before the desert came.\nI would like to take family there again to enjoy this lovely place.",
