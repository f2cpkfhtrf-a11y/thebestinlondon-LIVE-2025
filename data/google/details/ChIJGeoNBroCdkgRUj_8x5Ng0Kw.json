We ordered three starters (see pictures) and two pasta mains. The pasta was delicious, well-priced, and definitely the highlight of the meal, though the menu had fewer options than expected. Sometimes, less is more, but a bit more variety would have been nice.\n\nThe drinks menu was somewhat limitedâ€”there was a good wine selection, but only a few beer choices. The restaurant wasnâ€™t very busy, which made for a relaxed atmosphere. However, the space isnâ€™t wheelchair or stroller-friendly due to the steps, which could be a downside for some diners.\n\nOne issue was that we were mistakenly charged for an item we didnâ€™t order, though the staff did make up for it by offering a small takeaway tiramisu.\n\nGiven its prime location in the heart of Canary Wharf, this place has the potential to be a top Italian dining spot. With a few tweaksâ€”better accessibility, more menu variety, and attention to small service detailsâ€”it could truly stand out.",

She never made us feel rushed, and we truly appreciated her warm and professional approach.\n\nThe food was of high quality, although the vegetarian options were a bit limited. There were no soups available at the time, but overall, we had a great dining experience.\n\nA special shout-out to the staff for going above and beyond â€” two days after our visit, I realized I had lost my favorite hat and had a feeling I might have left it behind. Since we were staying nearby, I stopped by the restaurant, and to my surprise, they had found it and kept it safe for me. I was so happy and grateful!\n\nThank you all for the wonderful experience â€” both during the meal and afterward!",

We tried two kinds â€” the beef shin ragu pappardelle had a nice balance of sauce and pasta, really comforting and well done. The pesto seafood casarecce was okay, but didnâ€™t really surprise us. The flavour was quite one-note and got a bit heavy towards the end.\n\nThat said, the service was lovely and the atmosphere was great â€” very pleasant overall.",
