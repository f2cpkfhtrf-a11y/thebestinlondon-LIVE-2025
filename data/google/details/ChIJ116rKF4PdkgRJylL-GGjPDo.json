The food was delicious, flavoursome and moreish, we went with the lunch set menu and I opted for the seaweed tempura snack (who knew seaweed could taste so good!), and the brocolli side, along with the mastello main. Everything tasted incredible, and we were all quite stuffed upon heading back to the office. A few of my team members commented that they would be willing to try more vegan food in the future. A clear win here for this type of cuisine and chef Rishim's philosophy. The value proposition of the set lunch is great and I highly recommend it to anyone who reads this.\n\nI mentioned the lunch to my wife and she is very excited to visit, I'm certain I will be back.",
