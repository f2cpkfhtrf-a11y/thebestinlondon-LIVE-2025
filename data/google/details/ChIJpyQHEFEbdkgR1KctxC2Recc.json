Attention to detail is something that is clearly drilled into the entire staff. The level of care and professionalism provided such a relaxed and memorable dining experience. We went for the Chefs Menu for 3 guests and every course was close to being faultless. It was a fine example of simplicity done right with fresh ingredients and textures. I found myself asking the waiter about certain elements in each course that caught my attention as I was eating.\nAs you would expect, the waiting staff was informative and attentive. It’s visibly obvious to see that the standards are set very high and it was hard for me to find faults with the service at any point.\nWhenever I find similarities in specific dishes that I’ve had elsewhere, I tend to play the comparison game. Before going to Luca, the best fine dining pork dish I’d had was at Trinity in Clapham. On the chefs menu they served us a pork dish with beans and apricots. To say this was the standout dish by mile is an understatement, officially making it the best pork dish I’ve ever had. This is the true level of Michelin and it’s exactly what brings customers back for more.\n\nHighly recommend",

Food was top quality and service was good.\n\nIf I had to pick one suggestion / improvement - the staff appeared to be pressurizing with respect to ordering wine. Like trying to fill the glass more quickly than we desire as then we would have to order a new bottle. This sometimes felt a bit odd. But otherwise delighted with everything I saw and received.",
