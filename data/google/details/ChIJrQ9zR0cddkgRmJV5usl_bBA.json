We were served by Maryan who was friendly and helpful throughout and served with a smile which was nice.\n\nThe food came out relatively quick (but it was passed the evening rush) and the food was both tasty and hot. I’d say pretty standard in terms of its flavouring which is why I gave it an overall four stars. It just wasn’t fine dining but it was very good.\n\nPortions were hearty but everyone finished theirs. Shows they are thinking about things like that.\n\nThe place has great decor. We were in a booth. Was comfy.\n\nI would definitely go again. Service was strong and the food was decent.",

Great personality, great recommendations and made the whole experience one to remember.

The quality never disappoints, and it feels like you’re getting way more than what you pay for.\n\nI tried the Chicken Katsu Curry for the first time and it was AMAZING. Perfectly crispy chicken, rich curry sauce, and just overall so satisfying – definitely something I’ll be ordering again. And just to clear up something I’d seen floating around, it’s not free – I checked with the staff myself.\n\nOne thing I really appreciate here is how helpful and fabulous the staff are. They’re always friendly, attentive, and happy to answer any questions – especially when it comes to allergies. Most of the menu doesn’t contain nuts, but there are a few items that do, so I’d definitely recommend asking the staff just to be safe. They make the whole experience easy and reassuring.\n\nOverall, this place is a gem. Delicious food, great value, and consistent with both meals and service. I 100% recommend it to anyone (just make sure to double-check if you have allergies). You won’t regret it!",
