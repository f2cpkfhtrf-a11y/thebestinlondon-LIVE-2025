We entered the restaurant, our order was waiting for us. The menu was easy to use and matched the pictures and description. The service was very good. A little hot in the restaurant space but reasonable. Then the dishes arrived at the table. There were 4 of us and we ordered 9 dishes. We said if we wanted, we would take more. Very small dishes arrived. Most of them were not tasty. Strange and unbalanced seasoning. The main dish. which was delicious was the fried cauliflower. We decided not to order anything else. We went to finish our dinner somewhere else. We left very disappointed",

The concept and interactive tables are quite unique and fun, and the staff were friendly and efficient.\n\nHowever, the food didn’t fully meet our expectations — a few dishes lacked the freshness and flavour we were hoping for. Overall, it was an interesting experience, though the value for money could be improved.",

Prepare pills for the heartburn.\n\nThe service was friendly and they smile, but I have to give it a low mark because they didn’t do their job properly. We had to ask for plates several times. Only half way through our dinner they finally brought plates. Also, we ordered salmon with yuzu ponzu dressing, and it had no dressing. We asked about it, and they took it away, and we had to keep asking until 20 minutes later they brought it back… still with no ponzu or any other dressing. I think the staff doesn’t know what ponzu is so to avoid any further explaining, we put soy sauce on it and ate it like that.\n\nOne of the waiters was often asking “is everything OK?” but as I was saying “well, actually…” she was already gone.\n\nThe tables are touch panels from where you order. But they were sensitive to some of the plates we put on it and it was hard to order at times.",

While ordering the table menu crashed multiple times and everyone in our party agreed that we would have preferred paper menus. Several of the staff didn't really listen to us. We arrived with our party and needed to wait 5 minutes to be seated which was not an issue, but during that 5 minutes the same staff member irritably asked us 3 times about our reservation and each time we said \"we're already waiting to be seated, thank you\". Another staff member decided to show us how to operate the screens which was not necessary at all because one of our party had eaten there previously. A quick \"have you eaten with us before?\" would have been useful here. The food arrived fairly quickly but not always to the correct table. I asked twice if the dish I had just been handed was vegetarian and the server said \"yes both times\" only for my first bite to clearly reveal meat. I passed the dish along to a friend, but it was frustrating experience. All in all, some of the dishes were delicious, the Tamarind Mushrooms were beautiful! But with the unexpected (and mandatory) technology fee (£7.96 per table) + 12.5% service charge on top of already over priced dishes and infuriating table menus and checked-out staff this is not a place I'll be recommending to anyone.",
