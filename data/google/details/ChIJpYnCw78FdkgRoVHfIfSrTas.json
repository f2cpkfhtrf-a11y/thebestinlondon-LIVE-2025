We only remembered to mention that we would be bringing a child under 10 years old and asked whether the restaurant would accept that. Both the restaurant and I forgot to confirm that we would only need 2 tasting menus for the adults. My child would not be dining, just sitting with us. As a result, the restaurant prepared 3 tasting menus.\n\nRight after finishing the amuse-bouche, we clarified the situation. Normally, I would have been required to pay for all 3 tasting menus without being able to cancel at that point. Fortunately, the restaurant agreed to serve and charge us for only 2 tasting menus.\n\nThe food and quality were absolutely worth the price for such a culinary experience.\n\nWe truly value this restaurant!",

Do plan for a 3+ hours time to enjoy the tasting menu thoroughly. There were no ala carte menu.\n\nThe tasting menu comes with amuse bouche, bread with butter, 2 appetizers, 2 mains, 2 desserts, and petit four. There is also an option for additional caviar and / or additional cheese platters for extra $. The cheese platters were absolutely delicious. You get to choose 5 different type of cheese from the cheese cart. There were also pairing menu with wine, but we did not go for that. We had a few cocktails, \"XV\" was my favorite.\n\nAlthough each of the portion looks small, at the end of the tasting menu you will feel really full.\n\nService was great, all the servers were very attentive, knowledgeable about the food and drinks. We got the tasting menu list with us at the end.\n\nGreat atmosphere to eat with your family or friends.",

      "text": "The tasting menu went downhill since the main course. The duck with skin on was rubbery and chewy. Then the cheese course was just average. Pre-dessert and dessert were just mediocre. However, all the canapés and the first few courses were great. Having said that, the design of the overall tasting menu was quite poor, in my opinion, in terms of portion sizes amidst the technical misses. Fish and meat portion was tiny, but there are a lot of baked elements, what I see as dull \"dry\" food, including crumpet, brioche, biscuits, and madeleines. I don't have a food allergy, but eating too much bread in general felt stuffed, rather than stomach satisfied; not to mention the expectations of higher standards and culinary surprises. My favourites were crispy frog leg and crab. Black truffle bomb was also executed perfectly.\n\nThe restaurant interior was rather too dark to enjoy the dishes visually. By today's preferences, it feels a bit dated, rather than from a particular architectural style. Toilet facilities were located outside the restaurant in another part of the hotel via a flight of stairs. Not very convenient.\n\nService was OK. But I'm not sure how they took my comments that I didn't like the food much from the main course onwards. I heard faintly they were talking in the kitchen. Wall acoustic was not very well designed. At the end of the meal, they had IT issue printing the bill and said they would send me the receipt by email, but they didn't send it. Leaving me the impression that the hardware and the software of the restaurant were rather poor.\n\nConsidering the one-michellin-star restaurant competition in London, their price were set at the higher range, but they couldn't deliver the equivalent, so I'd conclude the tasting menu had a very low value for money.",

Overall it was a splendid experience.  The ambiance and feel was unparalleled.  The staff, especially the maître ď  on the floor was exceptional.  Every dish was amazing.  We ordered the black truffle add-on.  Oh yes!!   We also chose the wine pairing for me and the non-alcoholic pairing for my wife.  I recommend both of these pairings!  One of the wines was served in a dark glass with the staff wanting my guess on color and type.  Relax everyone, you’ll never be more wrong than me lol. We had only one complaint, the gentleman with the heavy accent serving several of the dishes had atrocious breath.  Very off putting.  Next time in London, we will definitely attend restaurant Gordon Ramsay!  4.9 stars!  Cheers!",
