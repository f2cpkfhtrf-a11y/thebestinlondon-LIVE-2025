We were seated right next to the food preparation station, which gave the evening a lively, behind-the-scenes feel and let us watch the chefs at work.\n\nFor starters we shared the BBQ bone marrow and tahini salad — both beautifully prepared and full of flavour. For mains we chose the lamb roast and the fillet steak; each dish was perfectly cooked, tender, and seasoned just right. To finish, we had the tiramisu and sticky toffee pudding — both indulgent and the perfect sweet ending.\n\nThe staff were warm and attentive throughout, and a special shout-out to the chef who was especially friendly and made the night feel personal.\n\nA memorable evening, amazing food, and a lovely atmosphere — highly recommend",

Despite this, we had to wait about 10 minutes before we were seated. Our mojito arrived with ice, but the drink itself was warm, so we had to wait for it to cool down.\n\nFor starters, we ordered bone marrow and mushroom soup. The bone marrow was so hot that I burned my mouth, but it tasted great. The soup was basically cooking cream blended with mushrooms—it looked like baby porridge. The taste was fine, but nothing special.\n\nFor the main course, we ordered harissa lamb, which had absolutely no flavor and no spices. The plating was also unattractive and messy. We also ordered a sirloin steak, which again tasted like nothing at all—I even had to ask for salt and pepper just to get some flavor.\n\nOverall, we left very disappointed and would definitely not recommend this restaurant.",

We arrived early evening and were seated immediately. Our server helped us to decide what to order as it was our first time here. We got the BBQ Marrow Bone (it was divine, I’d come back just for this!), the Lamb Roast and the Beef Wellington. Everything was amazing, great portion sizes, good quality ingredients and the flavours worked really well together.\nOur server was polite, informative and helpful, with the right balance of attentiveness and space to enjoy our meal - wish I’d taken his name!\nDefinitely will be dining here again and will recommend to family and friends, thanks for a great experience.",
