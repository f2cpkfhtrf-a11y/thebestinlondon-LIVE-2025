The flat white was not bitter at all and steamed to perfection with a great micro foam but still smooth and the right temperature. I wouldn’t definitely recommend and love the atmosphere there too !!",

The first time I had the tofu karaage and miso eggplant while my husband had the vegan  cheeseburger and chips. All the meals were absolutely delicious which is why we decided to return on our last night in London. This time my omnivore brother came with us and he ordered the cheeseburger and loved it. I ordered the tofu karaage again as it was so good, plus the vegan peking duck (no sin peking duck), which was also delicious. I love how all the dishes come with something pickled. They also have a range of pickled cocktails, which look amazing. I really wanted to try one of the desserts, but was too full! The caramel pavlova looked especially yummy.\nAs well as the food, the service is amazing. All the employees are super friendly and helpful and really make the place a joy to dine at. We all also loved the music selection, ranging from blues to 60s, 70s, 80s rock.\nI would definitely eat here again and recommend to anyone wanting a delicious meal in a great atmosphere.",
