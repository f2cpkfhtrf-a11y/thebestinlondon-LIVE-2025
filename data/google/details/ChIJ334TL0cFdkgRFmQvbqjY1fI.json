We had to return the chicken dish because it had a smell, was chewy and quite tasteless. The manager was nice enough to speak to the chef and cut it from our bill as we weren‚Äôt able to eat it and had it returned to the kitchen. The only reason I‚Äôm rating it 4 stars was due to the fact we felt a little rushed to place our orders. The service was good, but the front of house reception staff member was rude as we arrived 15 minutes late to a reservation which we did call in advance to let them know we were running behind schedule and they told us that it‚Äôs fine and they would hold our reservation, baring in mind when we arrived the restaurant it was half empty and there was lots of space as we left a couple of hours later. Other than that experience, the staff allocated to serving our table were kind and knowledgeable about the menu. The wait staff good suggestions and recommendations and they were attentive to our table. Really friendly and polite.",
