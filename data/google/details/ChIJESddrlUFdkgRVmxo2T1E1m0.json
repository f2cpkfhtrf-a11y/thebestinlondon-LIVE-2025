I was able to get a seat at the counter even though it was a busy time. I started with the sea bass ceviche, followed by the octopus from Galicia, both dishes were very good. For my main, I order the fish and chips, and it was fantastic. Their signature fish batter had a nice flavorful kick to it making different than your usual fried fish.",

The quality and freshness of the seafood are undeniable and absolutely five-star worthy. The kitchen is clearly doing a phenomenal job. However, the reason for not giving a fifth star comes down to the service, which unfortunately did not match the quality of the food. For a meal at this level, you expect a certain standard of attentiveness that was missing. For example:\nWe had to pour our own champagne from the bottle throughout the meal.\nI repeatedly had to get up from my table to find a waiter to ask for simple things like a finger bowl and, eventually, the bill.\nIt was very difficult to get anyone's attention, and while I understand they were very busy, the service shouldn't suffer to this extent. A final small point is that they dont accept cash and its a WiFi dead zone so I had to use their WiFi and again finding out the password required me to stand up and find a waiter. I paid by card without a problem, but its a policy some customers might appreciate knowing in advance. Overall, I would return for the incredible food, but I would have to adjust my expectations for the service. If the front-of-house could match the excellence of the kitchen, this would be an easy 5-star recommendation.",

We shared several appetizers — octopus, scallops, and shrimp — each cooked perfectly and full of flavor. There’s a clear Spanish twist to many of the dishes that makes them stand out from traditional seafood fare. Our server, Yorkina was awesome!\n\nThe fish and chips were the best I’ve ever had — light, crispy, and beautifully seasoned, again with that subtle Spanish influence that makes the dish unforgettable. Even the fries deserve a mention: thick-cut, golden, and perfectly crispy.\n\nOverall, The Seafood Bar delivers fresh, creative seafood with top-tier quality and presentation. Highly recommended for anyone who loves seafood done right.",
