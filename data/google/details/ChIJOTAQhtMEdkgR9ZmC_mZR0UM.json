Sadly a few inedible chewy bits which I had to  dispose of but the seasoning and sides were incredibly well thought and became a mini buffet, taking your buds on a culinary adventure. A special shout out to the Ash roasted sweet potato. The chips were the best I've had in a steak house. Think authentic hand cut chipppy chips, but cooked in beef fat and extra crispy and incredibly pillowy soft on the inside.\nThe bone marrow left me a little wanting, not a huge amount of flavour for something that is otherwise normally a flavour bomb.\nThe salad added a much needed cut through the overall richness and doubled as a convenient palate cleanser.\nThe white chocolate cheesecake was incredibly rich and ended what I felt was a very good meal.\nThe service was very good and our waiter was incredibly positive and helpful.\nThank you for a memorable meal, this was my first time and will definitely not be my last.",

The meat was grilled to perfection and the service excellent. The waiter knew everything in the menu and his advice was excellent for choosing the food. They were out of rib eye so we went for the rump cap which was very good. And finished everything with a more than generous portion of home made cheesecake. Will definitely go back next time in London.",

Personally, I stick to the beef medium-well and it’s perfect every time. And don’t leave without the cheesecake – easily the best I’ve ever had. Great hospitality and service, easy booking. The atmosphere is relaxed but lively, perfect for a Sunday meal with friends or family.",

      "text": "This restaurant is my absolute favorite place to eat in London, and we made sure to book a table three weeks in advance—it was the one place I knew I couldn’t leave the city without revisiting.\n\nAs always, the service was exceptional. John, our server, was a delight—attentive, personable, and spot-on with his recommendations, which set the tone for a memorable evening.\n\nFor starters, we ordered the cheese and pickle biscuits and the mushrooms on toast, both excellent choices to open the meal. For mains, we had the prime ribeye and a tenderloin fillet steak, accompanied by chips and roasted sweet potatoes. The steaks were flawless—juicy, tender, and cooked exactly to our request. Both cuts were packed with flavor, melt-in-your-mouth tender, and so well-prepared that they hardly needed sauce. Even so, we tried the garlic bone marrow and chopped sauce, both of which complemented the meat beautifully without overshadowing it.\n\nThe sides were well-executed, though the sweet potatoes deserve special mention. The chips were classic—crispy on the outside and fluffy inside—but not extraordinary. The roasted sweet potatoes, however, were spectacular: charred on the outside, fork-tender within, and perfectly seasoned, easily one of the best side dishes I’ve had in London.\n\nThe true star of the evening was dessert: their famous white chocolate cheesecake. Creamy, rich, and indulgent without being overwhelming, it remains my favorite dessert in London—simple yet brilliant, and the perfect way to end the meal.\n\nFor anyone seeking a steak dinner in London, you cant find any better than Blacklock. From service to execution, it delivers consistently, and for me, it’s unmatched.",

First of all, they only had one table at 10pm but after messaging the team on OpenTable despite them clearly being really busy they very kindly slotted us in earlier (thank you Olga!) The atmosphere is lovely, it’s not a large place but it’s buzzing and feels cosy and lively. The service was excellent - we got talked through the menu, the advice we got on what to order was great and our waiter suggested a primitivo instead of a house red which was amazingly light and one of the best reds I’ve had. We went for pigs head for starters (pulled pork on sourdough which comes with gravy), that was 10/10. We also ordered a Denver and a butcher cut Fillet with a side of broccoli salad and sweet potato. Everything was delicious! Denver reminded me of flat iron but thicker and gamier - not chewy at all and perfectly cooked. The fillet despite the size was melting on the inside with a charred exterior. Lovely sweet potato but the broccoli salad was phenomenal - it doesn’t even taste like broccoli, very crunchy and moreish with a beautiful dressing. Chop sauce is a classic peppercorn and we tried bernaise as well however in hindsight the meats didn’t need any sauces. We finished with sharing the white chocolate cheesecake and black coffees. The cheesecake was great but I’d maybe say it’s a white chocolate mouse constructed like a trifle almost with different layers you then sort of mix up - light, not too sweet, a perfect finish. And their coffee was spot on too. Our bill came to 101 for two with drinks, mains, starters, sides and a shared desert with coffee which is incredible value. All of the waiters that served us were attentive, friendly and looked like they are having fun which honestly makes such a great change from the usual. Thank you so much to the team for making our evening in London special and for the best food we’ve had in a while, we’ll be back!",
