The food was absolutely delicious, we shared sweet and sour chicken, chicken chow mein, bao buns and venison pastries, and every single dish was so tasty.  You could really tell the quality of the ingredients and the care that went into the cooking.\n\nA big shoutout has to go to our server, Hannah. She was so friendly, attentive without ever being overbearing, and genuinely made the whole evening feel special. It’s rare to come across service that feels that personal, and it honestly made all the difference.\n\nI have a peanut allergy, so I have to be careful eating out particularly with Chinese food, but Hannah handled it brilliantly. She was knowledgeable, reassuring, and made me feel completely at ease, which meant I could just relax and enjoy the meal.\n\nThe place itself is lovely and inviting, and seems like a great place for a casual lunch or a more formal dinner.\n\nThe combination of amazing food, a lovely atmosphere, and such thoughtful service made this the perfect place to celebrate. We left already talking about what we’ll order next time.",

For 3 people we ordered prawn chips , shumai, and XLB to start; then assam chilli king prawn (it is extremely spicy- fair warning!), crispy aromatic duck (quarter), pak choi with garlic, and Singapore fried noodle as mains.\n\nFood arrived fairly quickly and everything was fantastic. They swapped our initial appetizer plates for clean plates when the mains came out. They present the crispy duck to you whole, then return with it shredded (with the bone on the plate) so you dive right into it more easily.\n\nIf I was local I'd probably make it a habit to do pre-show dinner here regularly. Everything was great!",
