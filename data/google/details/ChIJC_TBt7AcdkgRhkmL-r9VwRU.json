They are pretty big. The crispy chicken skins were nice, but I think a dipping sauce with them would go a long way. Cocktails were good. Service was pretty slow, but overall would come back for the wings, they're very unique and some of the best in this style I've had.",

Food was absolutely delicious like 10/10 and the vibe was a nice cosy environment. It was very busy and a full restaurant throughout but not too busy to the point it affected our meal.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Yasmin she made our time 12/10 due to her customer service and know how of the menu and recommendations. I asked her about what drinks she'd recommend and picked the perfect drink and she basically ended up curating our whole meal. The chill wing was one of the best chicken wings I've had all year down to the exquisite sauce. And the massaman beef cheek was to die for!! Also had a daikon salad which added another dimension and the squid was divine also.\n\nShe encouraged to try the grilled cockles which i was skeptical at first but as i love seafood and her assurance I wouldn't be disappointed and explained where in Wales they come from and how to enjoy them with the lovely sauce and im so glad we trusted her judgement, i can't wait to go back to try them again!!\n\n5 star dining experience! Wish i could give them 6! Thanks again for everything Yasmin you are a superstar!!",

The mackerel and the thick noodle dish were very good, although the noodle dish seemed like it was “ all noodle” but the soup fish with the noodles had too much broth, not enough noodle. The “Asteroid” wine is excellent, as are the home made soft drinks.\n\nStrangely and rather irritating the noodle dish came out right away and then everything else twenty minutes later. Otherwise pleasant service at the bar.",
