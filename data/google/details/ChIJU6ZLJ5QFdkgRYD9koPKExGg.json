      "text": "Tucked away from the usual busy London spots, this restaurant is the kind of place you stumble on once and never forget. It doesn’t try too hard to impress from the outside, but the moment you step in, you realize you’re in for something special.\n\nWhat struck me most wasn’t just the food—it was the way the whole evening unfolded. The team here treats you like more than a customer. Stella greeted us with genuine warmth, Jeanie guided us through the menu with ease, and even the chef came by to personally recommend dishes. That kind of care is rare, and it set the stage for what turned out to be an extraordinary meal.\n\nThe food? Absolutely outstanding. Every plate felt alive with flavor and balance, from the starters—like nutmeg prawns and chicken satay—to the mains, where the rendang and crispy ribs stole the show. The rendang especially was a revelation: deep, rich, and melt-in-your-mouth tender. Even the sides, simple noodles and vermicelli, carried the same attention to detail. It’s the kind of cooking that makes you stop mid-bite just to appreciate what’s happening on the plate.\n\nBy the time we finished, it didn’t feel like we had just eaten dinner—it felt like we had been hosted. Stella came back to chat with us at the end, and it felt less like a formal check-in and more like closing the night with a friend.\n\nThis place is more than a restaurant—it’s an experience. Refined yet unpretentious, welcoming yet polished. Easily one of the best meals I’ve had in London, and one I’ll be telling people about for a long time.",

      "text": "Sometimes the best experiences come from chance, and this restaurant was exactly that. We had been looking for an Asian spot outside of the usual, over-visited choices in London and were drawn here by its high ratings, even though only a few people had reviewed it. Initially hesitant, we decided to give it a try—and it turned into one of the most unforgettable dining experiences I’ve had.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, the hospitality stood out. We were warmly greeted by Stella, the host, who guided us to our table downstairs. Soon after, our server Jeanie introduced us to the menu and provided a tablet with photos of all the dishes, which made choosing much easier. As we browsed, the head chef personally came to our table, welcomed us, and even helped us select some of their standout dishes. His warmth and genuine interest in ensuring we had the best experience set the tone for the night, and our chat with him made the evening feel personal and memorable.\n\nThe food itself was exceptional—truly beyond words. Every dish, from starters to mains to sides, carried bold, balanced, and deeply satisfying flavors. For starters, we had the Yin Yang nutmeg prawns, chicken rolls, grilled chicken satay, and pan-fried chicken and vegetable dumplings. Each offered a unique blend of flavors and textures, and all were outstanding. For mains, we chose the smoky beef rib rendang and the crispy beef ribs—both phenomenal, but the rendang in particular was remarkable, with beef so tender it was unlike anything I’ve had before. We also ordered the black pepper Angus beef and the red honey chicken, both rich and flavorful. Sides included egg noodles and vermicelli, each complementing the dishes beautifully. Every single item we tried was executed perfectly and left a lasting impression.\n\nTo end the evening, Stella returned to check on us, genuinely interested in our experience and eager to hear our thoughts. The conversation felt warm and sincere, more like speaking with a friend than a typical host–guest exchange. It was the perfect conclusion to an already incredible night.\n\nEverything about this restaurant—its food, service, and hospitality—was flawless. It is without question a 10/10 and, in my view, the best Asian restaurant in London. A true hidden gem that deserves far more recognition",

Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu, it might take some time!\n\nEvery dish I have tried so far has been great, with a lot of care invested into both the taste and the presentation. I've had char kway teow, Hainanese chicken rice, wagyu beef rice, chicken satay, chicken & vegetable dumplings, and kuih dessert. The chicken rice is especially great as it is difficult to get right outside Malaysia.\n\nCarry on the good work and I will see you again soon!",
