The staff were very welcoming and promptly provided us with menus to browse.\n\nWe ordered a Mix Platter and a Meat Platter, which turned out to be more than enough for our group. Shortly after ordering, we were served complimentary bread with chilli sauce, yogurt, and a fresh salad. The salad was beautifully presented and tasted great. The bread was also delicious – though slightly larger portions would’ve been perfect.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later, our main platters arrived and looked absolutely amazing. The Mix Platter 4 included ribs, lamb chops, chicken kebab, hot wings, and rice all cooked to perfection. The ribs and chops were especially succulent and full of flavour. Every item on the platter was tasty and satisfying.\n\nThe service throughout was excellent , the staff were attentive, friendly, and made us feel truly welcomed. Portion sizes were generous, and we left feeling very pleased with both the food and the overall experience.\n\nI’m definitely planning to return soon to try more dishes from their menu. Highly recommend this spot for anyone looking for authentic and delicious Turkish cuisine in East London.",

I am happy we opted for the platter for 2 as it gave us the chance to taste a variety of foods - all which were top tier. I recommend trying their special sauce! (Although food was still really delicious without the sauce). My kids were also happy with booster seat and the toys provided. Will definitely be dining here regularly.",
