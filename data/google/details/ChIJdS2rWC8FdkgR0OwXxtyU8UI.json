The sommelier was knowledgeable and eager to help find that right wine.\nThe food was cleverly presented and eye pleasing.\nThat had several dining option which was very much appreciated. Set menu pair with drinks or order a la cart\nThe thing you need to be aware is if you want a leisurely meal the set menu is at the kitchens pace. Felt a bit rushed and even the lunch menu states it’s designed to be an hour. Meaning looking to turn tables.\nThe waiter never made us feel rushed but the pace nonetheless felt it. Waiter tried to accommodate.\nIt is a bit pricey and value of food was almost there but was stretched. Again beautifully presented. We asked for our beef fillet medium rare but was medium well. But the value was made up by ambience and the staffs attention.\nSo more of a destination dining experience than a culinary destination.\nThat honestly stated , we had a most enjoyable dining experience.",

Even though the restaurant was very busy with a private event, she did her best to accommodate my request to change tables — something I truly appreciated.\n\nMy server, Peter, was outstanding — patient, attentive, and explained everything in detail, which made the whole dining experience even better. The food was absolutely delicious, and throughout the evening, different staff members checked in to make sure everything was perfect.\n\nSpecial mention to Zenek, the manager, who handled everything so professionally and ensured the atmosphere stayed smooth and enjoyable despite the busy night.\n\nHighly recommend this place for its incredible food, warm hospitality, and top-notch service.
