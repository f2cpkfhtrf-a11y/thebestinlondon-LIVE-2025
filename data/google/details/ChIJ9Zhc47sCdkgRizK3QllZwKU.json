Overall, it’s a nice place to go and enjoy food as well as drinks. I tried many dishes there including chicken and pasta and drinks like wine and signature cocktails. They were all amazing. It’s located in a nice and central place, close to my home. Staff is so kind and nice. The view is amazing, looking through the Isle of Dogs. A bit pricey but it is worth it. Highly recommended!",

The location itself is stunning, with street parking available nearby. The restaurant is large, spacious, and beautifully decorated – I absolutely love the colour scheme and overall design.\n\nIt’s quite rare to find authentic halal Italian, so this really is a gem, even though I went for vegetarian options. All of food was delicious, fresh ingredients, presented well, excellent quality, and the portions are absolutely huge. Not cheap but definitely worth the money.\n\nThe service was excellent, with very attentive and friendly waiters. It’s definitely a place I’d recommend and one I’d happily return to. I might even make it one of my regular spots whenever I’m craving Italian.\n\nI also can’t wait for the weather to warm up again so I can sit outside as I love al fresco dining, and this would be the perfect place for it.\n\nOverall, an excellent restaurant in every way.",

Everything, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left, was simply exceptional. It's safe to say that this is one of the best Italian dining experiences you can have in London, and I will definitely be returning.\nThe atmosphere is a perfect blend of modern elegance and welcoming warmth. The chic decor features contemporary lighting and stylish, comfortable furniture, creating a vibrant yet intimate space. We were a large group of 12 and had a fantastic table, with the restaurant offering plenty of great options for both inside dining and outside on the lovely terrace. It's a versatile space perfect for any occasion.\nThe food was beyond delicious, with each dish being a standout. The menu offers a great choice for all tastes, and the generous portion sizes mean you certainly won't leave hungry. Our table enjoyed a variety of dishes, and everyone raved about the quality, freshness, and authentic Italian flavours. The restaurant's commitment to using quality ingredients really shines through.\nTo complement our meal, we took full advantage of the excellent 2-for-1 cocktail offer. The cocktails were perfectly mixed and a delightful addition to an already superb afternoon/evening.\nWhat truly elevated our experience, however, was the impeccable service from our waiter, Kumar. He was outstanding throughout the afternoon, effortlessly looking after our large table of 12 with a positive attitude and without any issues. He was consistently attentive, friendly, and always there when we needed something. The service was a masterclass in hospitality.\nFor anyone looking for an outstanding meal in a beautiful setting with an exceptional team, look no further. I strongly recommend Capeesh Bar and Restaurant and look forward to my next visit!",
