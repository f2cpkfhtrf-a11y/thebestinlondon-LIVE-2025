If you’re looking for bold combinations and layers of flavor in every dish, this is the place to go.\n\nWe ordered several dishes to share:\n•\tBurrata & Peach — Fresh and enjoyable. The peach could have been riper and softer, which would have elevated the dish, but overall I would happily order this again.\n•\tHeritage Tomato — Interesting mix, tossed with olives, caperberries, pickled red onions, and spices, served over a bed of mild feta. Well-executed, but the flavors just weren’t what I was searching for, so I probably wouldn’t reorder.\n•\tGrilled Ox Tongue — Cooked beautifully, with the right balance of chewiness and tenderness. Served in slices with a buttery sauce, watercress and parsley salad, and shredded fried potatoes. Each element worked on its own, but together the flavors didn’t quite harmonize. Perhaps it felt muted compared to the brightness of the other dishes.\n•\tAubergine — One of NOPI’s signature dishes, and deservedly so. Creamy grilled aubergine paired with explosive flavors that linger. Absolutely delightful. If it had been served hot, it would have been next-level.\n•\tButtermilk Pork Chop — My favorite dish of the night. Grilled to perfection and paired with a vibrant chimichurri sauce that made it feel fresh and light. It also came with a mousse reminiscent of a lighter, more airy liver pâté, which added a subtle creaminess that elevated the pork beautifully.\n\nNote on seating: When making a reservation, you can choose between lower-level seating, counter seating, and ground-level seating. I recommend the ground level for the best ambiance. The lower level has large shared tables, great for smaller groups who enjoy a more communal setting with a view of the open kitchen.\n\nOverall: NOPI delivers inventive dishes with bold flavors and thoughtful presentation. While not every plate hit perfectly for me, the creativity and execution make it a restaurant worth returning to.",

My favorites were the aubergine dish, the tomato salad (this had a really flavorful dressing), the chickpea fritter (topped with yummy spread and grilled zucchini, and the mushroom risotto. Typically, the risotto at restaurants aren't very good, but here, it was delicious! I loved everything about it from the consistency of the risotto to the charred mushrooms on top. Note that some of the tables here are communal tables. We were told that the cheesecake (not a dessert, it was an appetizer) was their signature dish, but we ended up not enjoying it much. For some reason, the focaccia wasn't served warm and was very chewy, but the other dishes were so good that the food here is still five stars!",
