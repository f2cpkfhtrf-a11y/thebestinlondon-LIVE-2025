They have a vegan set with some sides, the okonomiyaki and miso soup; all great. They also had plenty of vegetarian options. Everyone (including meat eaters) thoroughly enjoyed their food. All staff were really friendly and helpful. They even had vegan dessert. Fab it's all cooked in front of you like in Japan, staff were very cautious to keep everything separate so my vegan one didn't touch the meat/veggie ones etc.  Lovely experience. I would recommend and return.",

Each table has a built-in teppan (hot plate) on which your okonomiyaki (Japanese savoury pancake) is cooked right before your eyes. Watching the batter, ingredients, and sauces meld on the grill is part of the fun, it turns your meal into a mini performance. The staff are warm, friendly, and helpful,they take time to explain the menu and grilling process, especially if it’s your first time. You’ll likely spend around £25 per head (excluding drinks)",

We tried two — the tofu kimchi and one recommended by our server — along with omsoba, and everything was fantastic. The staff were so warm and welcoming, and our host made the evening extra special by chatting with us and explaining the dishes. We had high expectations when we sought this place out, and it truly delivered. A perfect spot to celebrate our anniversary — we left so happy and content with the amazing food!",

We went there as a family of 4 with two young children, staff there made us feel very welcome, explained very well about the dishes and made lovely recommendations for us. The experience watching staff cooking the okonomiyaki was amazing, children loved it and watched with amazement. You can also feel they really care about your experience and the food was gorgeous! My husband was never keen about prawn but the prawn gyoza has turned him around and he loved every bite of it! The freshness of their ingredients really made a difference!\n\nWe weren’t going to have dessert but decided to have some because we hear good reviews about them, and it did not disappoint. I particularly love the red bean sauce in my dessert. The food at Abeno is well worth a visit and we will definitely come again. Thank you Abeno.\n\nAdvice for family with young children: the table has hot surface where the food is cooked, so I would only recommend for family with children who are calm and less likely to climb all over.",
