So concentrated. The food they sent out was perfect. The tasting menu gave me so many different foods. And I loved that the Michelin Star food felt so personal and homely. When the staff tells so you to spoon the gravy with the bread you are in the right place ðŸ˜Š A Michelin star restaurant where you can your fingers dirty, And the wine pairing. Perfect. The sommelier knows what he is doing. Just listening to him makes your evening. Thanks to the whole team for a perfect night.",

      "text": "We revisited Frog by Adam Handling after eight years, this time celebrating a friendâ€™s 21st birthday. Weâ€™d previously enjoyed the private dining room downstairs, but for this occasion we chose the main dining space upstairs.\n\nWe opted for the lunch menu, which began with three amuse-bouches, followed by Parker House bread and butter, a fish course, a duck course, dessert, and petits fours. One of the highlights is that you can bring your own wine at lunch with no corkage fee (though there is one at dinner).\n\nThe interior is vibrant, with an open-plan kitchen, bench-style seating, and bold artworkâ€”including modern takes on portraits of the late Queen and the current King. We sat at a circular table near the window with its striking white rubber surface.\n\nAmuse-bouches\nâ€¢\tTuna & herbs: a delicate pastry cup filled with tuna and topped with bright herbs.\nâ€¢\tCrab, green chilli, buckwheat: a crisp cylindrical shell filled with white and brown crab meat, subtly spiced.\nâ€¢\tChicken & egg: crispy chicken skin served inside an eggâ€”imaginative and delicious.\n\nBread & butter\nThe Parker House bread was warm and beautifully presented in a tear-apart loaf. The standout, though, was the butter: chicken skin butter with a rich chicken parfait centre, elegantly shaped like a rose.\n\nPalate cleanser\nA cucumber tea served between courses was refreshing but fairly simple compared to the other dishes.\n\nFish course\nCod with courgette and smoked fish elements. The presentation was stunning, with courgette prepared in several ways. However, the portion of cod itself was surprisingly small.\n\nMeat course\nMerrifield duck with apricot and cobnuts. The sauce was superb, though the duck portion was again on the small side.\n\nDessert\nVerbena, Earl Grey, and peachâ€”a beautifully balanced dessert that was tart, sweet, slightly sour, and visually elegant.\n\nPetits fours\nA seeded madeleine served with cream and raspberry jam. Pleasant, though not as memorable as the other courses.\n\nService & atmosphere\nThe service was warm, attentive, and interactive throughout. Adam Handling wasnâ€™t in the kitchen during our visit but did make an appearance in the dining room, as his family was also dining there.\n\nAfterwards, we noted that the cocktail bar Eve, located downstairs, opens at 4pmâ€”a stylish spot to continue the afternoon with drinks.",

We were shown to our table and given the wine list whilst the server showed us some options for champagne, myself had some fizz whilst the husband had a glass of red wine. The food was sensational. Each course was brought to us with a description of what the dish was and the inspiration behind the dish.\nWe had 5 courses and each got better and better! The lamb main courses and strawberry desert were a highlight for me. My husband went for the extra cheese course, which he said was outstanding. The truffle honey was deliecious . 100% recommend this restaurant, friendly service, and an amazing experience. I can't wait to return!",
