The shrimp tacos was my favorite personally and the crab tostadas was my partner’s. We also got a t-bone with a side of potatoes and fresh, warm tortillas which we definitely recommend - meat was very tender, juicy, and seasoned.\n\nHas become my favorite Mexican restaurant in London but is a little bit on the pricier side if you’re looking to get a casual bite.",

The restaurant itself is stunning, right on King’s Road, with thoughtful design touches everywhere (even the bathrooms are gorgeous!).\n\nThe food was seriously impressive—everything we ordered was so flavourful and beautifully presented. The fish tacos were a real standout and perfectly balanced. You could tell each dish had been prepared with real care and attention to detail. We also noticed a really lovely private dining space downstairs, which looked ideal for a more intimate celebration.\n\nAlthough the service was a little on the slower side, we honestly didn’t mind. It suited the pace of a long, relaxed lunch, and our servers were genuinely kind and attentive, clearly wanting to make our experience a great one.\n\nWe finished with the tres leches cake and it was truly exceptional. Will be thinking about it for a long time!\n\nIxchel is such a great find—fantastic food, a beautiful atmosphere, and ideal for a slow, indulgent afternoon with good company. We’ll absolutely be back.",

There was something for everyone - lots of vegetarian options too. The salsa was actually super spicy, hard to find these days - so yummm! The wine was incredible too.
