But the thing that can make or break an experience is the waiter. We had Jass and this young man did an outstanding job taking care of all the outdoor patio tables and was always on top of things. Lovely place and I’m glad we were able to walk you and get a table. We sat outdoors and it was cold outside but with the heaters they have installed I was warm! To finish things we split the tiramisu and it was delicious just like every thing else. Great place and atmosphere was on point.",

Ozzy was our waitor and he was very attentive.\n\nWe had the burrata salad which was very tasty, the octopus cappacio was not as good but then I guess octopus doesn't have a strong flavour anyway, but the beef cappacio was very good.\n\nNow, the main courses, wow! The truffle pasta was my favourite, the pasta itself had a great texture, and what I liked the most is that it wasn't soaked in cream, which often happens with a mushroom/truffle pasta dish.  Then the beef Ragu tagliatelle was also great, the beef Ragu was well cooked and seasoned, the tagliatelle again had a great texture.  We also had the risotto mare, there were lots of seafood in it (big prawns, baby squid, clams) and it was definitely cooked with a suace made from the prawns heads, it was super tasty.  We also had the pizza and it was great too.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the tiramisu and chocolate bomb, both were very tasty as well, but they were quite heavy, so we were glad that we shared the desserts amongst the four of us.\n\nGreat restaurant, will definitely go again, high recommend it to anyone that's looking for a good quality Italian restaurant to visit in central London.",
