The staff were also really kind and explained the menu or recommendations well. I was a little disappointed in the restaurant decor itself. It seemed like a place that needs a decor revamp, a bit of love and excitement to go into it. I would still recommend, but I think it could be more high end. Great for casual dining.",

Overly salty, soggy, and clearly fried from frozen.\n\nService was even worse. We arrived shortly after opening with only one other table occupied but were seated beside the stairs to the toilets at an awkward two-person table. When we asked to move, the male staff refused, claiming all other tables were reserved, even though most stayed empty throughout our meal. He was also unnecessarily rude when I briefly took a phone call.\n\nThankfully, a female staff member later served us and was polite, but the overall experience remained unpleasant. After placing our order, closer to half past, we noticed that most tables were still empty and asked again to move to a better table, but she also refused, saying they were reserved. It was extremely distracting to have staff constantly walking up and down the nearby stairs during our meal. Several “reserved” tables were later given to walk-ins or remained empty.\n\nAll this happened within just 45 minutes of our stay. This was my companion’s first meal after arriving in the UK, and it left a very poor impression. We were very mad at the poor service, and this was no way to treat customers. Our first and last visit to Sanjugo.",
