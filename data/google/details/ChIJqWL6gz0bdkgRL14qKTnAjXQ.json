      "text": "Visiting Dishoom King’s Cross for the first time was a real treat, and it certainly lived up to its reputation. My wife had been before, so she already knew what to expect, but for me it was something completely new. We were slightly pressed for time as we had a train to catch back up north, so I was a little worried about queues and delays. Sure enough, when we arrived there was already a queue forming outside, and the weather looked like it was about to turn. Thankfully, the team at Dishoom were quick to act – we were seated outside almost immediately, and service began straight away. That efficiency made a big difference, as it meant we could relax and enjoy the meal without clock-watching.\n\nThe setting itself was welcoming, even outdoors. Despite the looming rain, the atmosphere carried the lively, bustling energy that Dishoom is known for. There’s a sense that you’re part of something bigger than just a restaurant – more like a communal dining experience where everyone is there for the same reason: good food and a warm vibe. By the time we were leaving, the rain had just started to fall, which made the timing feel almost perfect.\n\nAs for the food, it really was excellent. Everything we ordered arrived quickly and was cooked to perfection. Dishoom has a reputation for bold, flavourful Indian dishes that balance authenticity with modern touches, and that was exactly what we experienced. From the seasoning to the presentation, nothing felt rushed despite our limited time. It’s rare to feel both unhurried and well-looked after in such a busy spot, but the staff managed it brilliantly.\n\nOverall, Dishoom King’s Cross was a fantastic first-time experience for me. Efficient service, delicious food, and great timing meant we left full, happy, and on schedule for our train.",

I will say, the waiter warned my party that it was quite spicy, however I have had spicier. People who can tolerate mild spice will be able to enjoy this dish - it does have a kick, but it is not too intense. Also, I would recommend having a reservation to avoid waiting in a long line to dine. Will be returning next time I am in the city!",

(Check out the loos - lol)\n\nI found that for the portion sizes you were getting, the prices were pretty inflated. To pay £18 for a biryani and get nothing on the side - not even a small bit of raitha (you normally get this whenever you have an authentic biryani) was disappointing. Paying the same amount (£18) for a single portion of chicken curry - this would normally cost max £15 or less! Similarly, paying over £5 for a small naan or roti was again, disappointing.\n\nWe were in a group, and felt rushed by the lady serving us. Whilst she was pleasant overall - I understand that the restaurant may be busy, but members of our group were feeling pressured by the way she was communicating and taking orders which is not how you want to feel when dining out! Especially when there is a big group of us there for a celebration.\n\nBreakfast options look a little more interesting and accessible !\n\nDishoom is great if you’re after a surreal atmosphere that makes you feel like you have been transported to India, and want to splurge on something a bit special! But unfortunately due to the above, I won’t be coming back anytime soon!",
