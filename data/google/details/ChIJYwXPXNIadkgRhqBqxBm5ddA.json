Arrived at 5.40pm before opening - there was already a large queue however it went fairly quickly considering. Security on hand to ensure everything ran smoothly. Guests were buying drinks at the restaurant bar next door which was nice (if that’s your thing whilst waiting). We were served by some lovely ladies who were organised - food came out quickly and we didn’t feel rushed. Nice authentic French brassiere feel. Loud but you can still hear each other. Chose medium for the meat which was nicely pink. Enjoyed the desserts too, not too sweet. If you’d like to get in early for dinner I’d say arrive at 5-5.15pm",

The main course, of course, is the steak and fries it’s truly delicious. As for desserts, the profiterole and the tower-shaped version of it are great; the classic one tastes better, but the tower is perfect for sharing.\n\nThe service is excellent — the staff are very elegant, kind, and genuinely beautiful in the way they present themselves, and they always look so polished and well-put-together, which adds to the restaurant’s charm. Everything is clean,beautiful and well-organized.\n\nThe only downside is that it can get crowded and there can be a queue in the evenings and on weekends, and the tables are a bit small, but that’s understandable since it’s always busy inside. Definitely a place worth visiting not just once, but many times.",

It was Sunday after 1pm, we queued and waited for half an hour for a table, which was not too bad.  There only one set menu that covers bread, salad, steak and fries.  They offer one refill of steak and fries.  The food was good but not great.  The seat setting was very close to each others.  We had two bottles of house red at £27 a bottle, that was reasonable.  Unfortunately we didn't check the bill when we pay until two hours later when I looked at the photo of the receipt and found that they had charged us three bottles of red.",

      "text": "I actually like this place. Nothing to complain about. You get a starter, which is a salad with walnuts, two rounds of your steak and fries, good selection of wine, dessert for about £100 (for two people). Yes, you're crammed into the restaurant but you have to expect it when there is a queue going into the place most of the time. The service is fast, the food is delicious. If you don't make it in the first round of people, you'll end up waiting between 30-45 mins for a table.",

      "text": "First of all, I'd like to say that this is a restaurant in London that will definitely satisfy your hunger. Even though we arrived during dinner service, we waited in line for about 30-45 minutes. The restaurant was very elegant and crowded. All the wait staff we saw were women of various ages. The modest salad, a small bowl of lettuce, walnuts, and mustard, was wonderfully flavorful and filling. They told us they only cooked the meat medium or rare. They served half of the meat with plenty of fries and sauce. Then they served the rest of the meat and plenty of home-style potatoes. The wine they recommended and all the desserts were excellent.",
