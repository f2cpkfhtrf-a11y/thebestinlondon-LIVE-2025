Plus it was 11.30 and this place was open already… I took my chances after seeing their Isaan menu.\n\nOn walking in, one of the staff immediately barked at me that I could only have the table for 1 hour.  Great start.\n\nI then made the mistake of asking for “kor moo yang” rather than “moo yang” and was told to only order from the menu. I explained my error and then ordered the som tam pu (from the menu, ironically) and was told they couldn’t do that, as they didn’t have the the little field crabs available. (I agreed to have it without the crabs and just pl raa and got charged an extra pound anyway…)\n\nI asked for Thai spice with the som tam and it had decent heat. It could have done with some more lime juice for balance in my view (and to make it less dry), but that’s a matter of taste. It was also pretty expensive at £10.95 given the size. The pork was tender and marinated fine but came topped with sesame seeds randomly. The sticky rice was quite hard and dry. Came to just over £30 with service. And the service remained prickly for the duration…\n\nOverall, average at best. Given the service this falls into the “avoid” category for me.",

Service was friendly and knowledgeable on the dishes.\n\nThe food was well priced (noting the mains do not\ncome with rice/noodles etc) considering the area/price I would be happy to recommend to friends visiting the area.\n\nThe chilli oil stir fry did taste delicious but wasn’t spicy at all despite having 1 spice showing ‘Mildly Hot’\n\nThe Cola is not on tap and only cans are available. No table water was offered. The food was quite salty but was great. The mint after payment was a nice welcoming touch.\n\nWill visit again when in town. If you have servers allergies might be best to avoid visiting - as I have a mild molluscs allergy and I don’t feel like it was entirely accommodated for. 12.5% service charge added to bill.",
