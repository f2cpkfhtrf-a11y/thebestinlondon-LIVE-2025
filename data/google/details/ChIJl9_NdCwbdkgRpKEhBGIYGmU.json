There were two of us eating so we tried all the meat options (vegetarian options available, but we didn't try those)\n\nThe whole meal was lovely, but there was a few dishes in particular which were amazing. The cured trout starter tasted very fresh, with a simple yet delicious flavour, topped with roe. The pork tenderloin was cooked excellently, texture was almost like a filet mignon, but with the rich flavours of pork. Pain perdu with tonka bean dessert was a lovely end to the meal, not too sweet, just how I like it. The other dishes were also excellent.\n\nOverall a great restaurant, well deserving of its michelin star. I'll definitely have to come again to try the à la carte menu.",

Both the beef cheek & tongue, and the Iberico pork pluma were exceptionally tender and flavourful.\nWe ordered two of their pastas - the squid ink malloreddus and truffle conchiglie. Both were lovely, even my husband who doesn’t eat much pasta loved them a lot.\n\nBoth desserts we had were nice but their signature Pain Perdu is a must, perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\nWaitress was very friendly and informative, we were not in a rush but noticed the service was a tad slow though. Can’t comment on the wine pairings as we didn’t order this.",

The only \"wrinkle\" on an otherwise incredible experience was the fact that when we booked the dinner, the price of the three-course option was £38. However, when we arrived a month later, the price went up to £44. What??? Nearly 16% increase in ONE month?! Also the 25% (!!!) service charge was added to our bill, which is obviously ludicrous. It is discretionary though. Apart from that, it was a beautiful dinner and the waitresses were very friendly.",

I think they may have been short staffed this day but this did not impact our experience.\n\nFrom start to finish the food was incredible, the crab spaghetti though was an absolute stand out winner in my eyes!! It had the most incredible flavour and the samphire was a welcome addition, but there were little crunchy bits that simulated the feeling of eating crab, they weren’t to crunchy but had enough crunch to really give you the feeling.\n\nThe pork was amazing, and lots of the lovely fish dishes. I can definitely recommend coming here, after drinks it pushed the price up, but for £35 for the set menu what’s not to like.\n\nWe came here because we were told to, now I’m telling you to. 🤤",
