With some Tartare, Mussels toast and Pigeon skewer to begin with.\nAnd then some Dover Sole, Mallard, vegetables and potatoes. All that with a side of bread and butter. And a cheesecake finish.\n\nService was great and they explained everything. Wine list was also great with lots of options (including Sherry and Dessert wine)\n\nI highly recommend the place",

      "text": "Beautiful restaurant with highly imaginative cooking. The only areas where it comes up a little bit short are, first, value for money - the portions are small considering their prices, and the pricing on the grilled fish and meat is particularly dear. Second, the dining room is packed in a little bit tight and there is very little room to manoeuvre, once you arrive and are sat you pretty much have to stay put as the dining room is very dense and very busy. The vegetable dishes were the star of the show and if I were to do it all over again I would order only vegetarian dishes and a bottle of wine. Standout items were the red peppers cooked for 24 hours in sherry and olive oil, the skewer of squid and sobrassada, the squash with seasonal greens and yogurt, and the chocolate sorbet with plum. I’d booked the restaurant for a special occasion, and besides acknowledging that from their notes nothing was done about it including not providing the table by the kitchen as I had requested and they’d promised to do. Overall glad we went and we did enjoy the vibe and the overall experience.",

      "text": "Mix bag feeling after my first visit and considering the price point and the 1 Michelin star rating.\nQuality of ingredients is great and flavours are clean and strong. However, food was like warm and a very long wait between starters and mains. This was also the case for the 2 tables next to us and even the waiter was advising other tables to place their order all together as there will be long delays in serving the main. So it feels like a regular issue.\nService was great and attentive. When commenting on the delays, they positively reacted.\nAtmosphere is more one of a gastro pub than a Michelin star. Tables too close to each other, you are literally touching elbows with your neighbours. I would also expect a proper napkin at this price level and not a paper one. Cutlery and china are basic.\nMaybe the venue in Hackney delivers more buck for money but I was not really impressed here. Feels like they are squeezing the maximum juice from their reputation here and rely on tourist to fill their seats.",
