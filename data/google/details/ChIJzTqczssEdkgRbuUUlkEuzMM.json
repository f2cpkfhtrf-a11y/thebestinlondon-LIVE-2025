We also had delicious Patatas Bravas and some anchovies in vinegar.  I typically don’t overly love potatoes and these were great.  I would definitely recommend this to others and return.  There are a couple of tables and seats inside of you want to eat, but it might be hard for a large group to fit.",

Something more formal than usual, but all the restaurants nearby were fully booked (obviously). So we moved a bit outside the busiest plaza and ended up in front of casa Manolo, which, from outside, looks like more like a food shop rather than a place where eating. Tempted by the flavours in the air we got in and, even though quite small, we found a table available. I thought they could sell only sandwiches with jambon or queso, and, instead, there was a pretty serious menu. And most of what we got was really good (i didn'tlike very much the patatas bravas...everythingelse was great). It's a nice surprise, and it definitely deserves a bite if you are around. You can also buy food from there in case you want to bring back with you some delicatessen! The guys working there were very nice and helpful. It was an enjoyable experience. But do not spend too much time at the table after your meal...otherwise they will ask you to leave to give space to other customers!",
