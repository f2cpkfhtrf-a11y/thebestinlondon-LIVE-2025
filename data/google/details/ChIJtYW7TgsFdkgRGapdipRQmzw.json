They offered to box our food without us asking, which was appreciated.\n\nThe menu offers a vast selection, including cocktails and puddings. I had the Dan Dan Mian with tofu lamb, which looked so good my friend ordered it too. My boyfriend chose the chat, which he also enjoyed, and tasted good to me!\n\nWe loved it so much we stayed for another round of drinks. Can’t wait to go back and tackle some more of the menu!",

      "text": "We recently discovered Vantra during a short trip to London, and I’m so glad we did! Honestly, it turned out to be one of the best dining experiences I’ve ever had.\n\nWe started with the vegan “meat” skewers in a peanut-like sauce. So flavorful that we kept the plate on the table just to dip our fries into the sauce later (it was that good!). Then came a kind of flatbread topped with fresh ingredients, and finally the absolute highlight: a sushi burger served with a mix of potato and sweet potato fries, delicious dips, and a side salad. Now, I usually don’t even eat salad, but this one had a yogurt-based dressing that was so tasty I practically devoured it. Everything on that plate was a win.\n\nWhat stood out to me is how Vantra manages to cook with a focus on health and protein-rich meals, but without ever falling into the “healthy but tasteless” stereotype. Everything was vibrant, flavorful, and satisfying. The whole menu felt unique and adventurous! Nothing “standard” or boring, but carefully thought-out dishes that make you excited to try something new.\n\nThe drinks menu was just as impressive. They had a wide variety of creative cocktails and “Vocktails”. As someone who loves alcohol-free cocktails, I was thrilled to see so many tasty options. I could have happily tried them all! My boyfriend went for a milkshake and it was equally tasty.\n\nThe atmosphere at Vantra was another highlight. My partner and I are both neurodivergent, and after a full day in busy, overwhelming London, stepping into this restaurant felt like entering another world. The lighting was gentle (bright enough but not harsh), the music was calm, and we could talk easily without raising our voices. Another big plus was that the restaurant wasn’t crowded or noisy. There was enough space to feel comfortable and relaxed. We actually asked about it, and were told that while it can be busier on event days, it’s usually a peaceful place to eat. That made the whole experience even more enjoyable for us. Even the restrooms were clean and well-kept, which for me is always an important detail and a definite plus.\n\nThe service was kind and welcoming throughout, and at the end we even had a lovely chat with one of the staff members who explained more about the restaurant. She mentioned how fully vegan restaurants are unfortunately declining in the UK, which made me feel even more strongly about supporting places like Vantra. They absolutely deserve it.\n\nThe only minor point I could mention is that there isn’t a menu available on the website. But after hearing the reason (the menu changes seasonally, depending on what’s available), it made perfect sense and actually reflects the restaurant’s commitment to freshness and creativity.\n\nAll in all, Vantra is an absolute must-visit, not only for vegans but for anyone open to trying something truly unique and delicious. We left so happy with our choice and will definitely return next time we’re in London!",
