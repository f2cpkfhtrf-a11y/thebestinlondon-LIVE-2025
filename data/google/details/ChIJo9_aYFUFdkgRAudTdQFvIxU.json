I checked online and found they are popular for their dim sum but also their roast meat.  I decided to pay them a visit as I love duck and pork dishes.\n\nMy first impression was good as they were happy for me to make a reservation for one person and were very responsive to my requests.\n\nI had a three-course meal of Deep Fried Crispy Aromatic Duck, Roast Meat Rice (BBQ Pork and Crispy Pork) and Banana Fritters.  I had also planned to have the House Special Bean Curd but had no room after my main course.\n\nAll the dishes I had were delicious.  The duck was probably the best I have ever had.  It was crispy on the outside and the meat was not at all dry but succulent.  I had no problem finishing all the pancakes.  I asked for egg fried rice and it was well cooked, along with the two types of pork.  The pork meats were full of flavour but not overpowering.  The banana fritters were a great end to the meal.  Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\nThe service was also very good.  The servers were attentive but not at all intrusive and I did not have to wait very long at all between courses.\n\nOne thing to note is that the restaurant was rather noisy and not the best place for a quiet or intimate meal.  I was glad that I had my noise cancelling headphones with me.  I would also recommend making a reservation, as it was very busy.\n\nI definitely recommend Gold Mine if you fancy having Chinese cuisine, especially their roast meat dishes.  I hope to make another visit soon to try their dim sum, as it looks very good.",

Service was efficient and friendly.\n\nI ordered the pork dumplings, chef recommended chili chicken special (served cold, see photo), and a side of egg fried rice.  Prices are steep for a Chinese restaurant, but I think this is typical in the UK.\n\nI also ordered a dry martini, which tasted too sweet and as soon as I let the server know, she immediately took the item off the bill.\n\nThis place reminded me so much of a typical Cantonese style dim sum restaurant in New York Chinatown so there was a touch of sweet nostalgia for me.\n\nAll in all, I would come to this restaurant again and again!",
