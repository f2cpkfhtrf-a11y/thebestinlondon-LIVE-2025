On entry, the acoustics were on par for a pub and the decor of the place matched that of a pub. Our hostess was accommodating of our early arrival and seated us promptly on the 3rd floor. Our waitress Siri and her trainee were nothing but phenomenal. For 146 pounds we had 2 glasses of wine, 1 Guinness, one 3 scallop appetizer,  one 12oz ribeye, 3 lamb chops, mashed potatoes, salad, and sticky toffee pudding with ice cream. At this price point I will certainly be returning. Also I would be remiss if I didn't highlight the details of each portion of our meal: the wine (Devonshire special) was spicy but a great pairing for red meat, the scallops were tender, the meat items were true to temperature, the mashed potatoes were delicate, the salad sufficient, the sticky toffee pudding was to die for: a warm coarse texture intricately balanced by cool smooth ice cream. The Devonshire deserves a 10/10 and nothing less.",

Such fantastic value for what you get. Everything was so tasty, and the bread and butter that is also served with it is so good. Just a cracking experience and I highly recommend you book, if only for the wonderful pint of Guinness. It just tastes better! Thanks Devonshire and all the staff for making me and my wife's experience a memorable one. Shout out to the waiter on Saturday lunch time who served us, we were on table 28 if that helps!

Never have I had such an amazing steak in my life, it was cooked over charcoal right in front of you which is just amazing!\n\nThe service was brilliant, the food was superb, and the sticky toffee pudding was out of this world. The scallops were beautifully cooked as well with that vinegary taste which was lovely. You do also get bread and salted butter for the table, and it was very good. We had the Guinness Zero and that was like the ones you get in Dublin.\n\nNeed to book in advance to get a table, though during the quieter hours of a weekday, you should be able to get a table.",
