The restaurant is located toward the middle of the building on the ground, but it's filled with natural light and has a bright, welcoming atmosphere. There are various types of seating, and if it's not too crowded, the staff will kindly let you choose the kind of seat you prefer, which makes the experience even more pleasant.\nEveryone from the reception to the servers was polite and warm, and I truly appreciated the thoughtful and graceful service. Every dish I tried was carefully crafted and absolutely delicious. This is definitely a place I'd love to visit again.",

The fried rice was full of flavor due to having so many different components and seasoning, and every bite felt like an incredible, new experience. The pork belly was also very enjoyable and my only complaint was that there wasn’t more of it on the plate! I was also quite surprised by the serving size of the fried rice; it could have easily fed 3! The service was also perfect, my waitress was attentive and helpful throughout (as I had a few questions). Definitely a 5-star experience!",

Our waiter was very attentive and the food arrived quickly.\n\nWe got the hot chicken burger for £18 which came with chips, and the pineapple fried rice for £23 (which came served in a pineapple)…fun, but not the most practical to eat from!\n\nBoth were tasty, but overpriced in my opinion! They were normal portion sizes, and in my experience, you can order similar items for around £15-18 from other Thai restaurants for similar quality…\n\nSide note, both had lots of coriander mixed in, so tell your waiter if you don’t prefer that!",
