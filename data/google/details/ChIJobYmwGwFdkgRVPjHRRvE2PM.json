Soft serve with honey toast was an interesting offer that we don’t see many in other cafes/bakeries so it was lovely. Wanted the vanilla flavour soft serve but it was sold out so I had the chocolate one which was decent. The honey toast that came with it was a little too sweet and dry though. It’s a lovely place with great vibes for a coffee with a friend, to rest your legs after some shopping in central London but not specifically be there for the baked goods. Menu offers breakfast/brunch type of food I have yet to try but I’ll probably skip that. Staff were extremely helpful and kind though. Made us feel really welcomed despite being so busy.",

The labneh cherry tomato toasty was the best savory breakfast sandwich you can ask for to be balanced with the sweetness of the blueberry tart - which is easy to miss, but not in Chestnut - every bite you get fresh blueberries and never a jammy sticking to your teeth goo, but a wonderful creamy filling encased by the more exquisite laminated dough.\nNot one miss!",

Even though the cafe was open we was told upstairs seating was closed. Wanted the Karak tea which wasn’t available, either was the brookie. Ordered two scoops of ice cream which I asked for choc. Then I see one of the guys giving vanilla asked the lady that was serving me that I asked for choc which she said there wasn’t any available even though she took my order. She wasn’t paying attention as she kept repeating my order. As we sat with our hot choc and the basic vanilla ice cream. We can see the bins getting taken out, everything getting cleared up. There was still people coming in. Considering we were in convent garden and you pay more than average I don’t expect to see huge bins going past me multiple times, aswell everything getting cleared up. The cafe is open and should accommodate accordingly during the opening hours. Won’t be coming in a hurry anytime soon.",

      "text": "Chestnut Bakery in Covent Garden has quickly become one of my favorite spots in London for pastries and coffee. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, with a modern yet cozy design that makes it perfect for a relaxed break during a busy day in the city.\nThe staff are friendly, which adds to the overall experience and makes you feel at home even in the middle of a busy area like Covent Garden.\nThe highlight for me is definitely their tiramisu Danish. It’s unlike anything I’ve tried before. It feels indulgent without being overly sweet, and it’s the kind of pastry you’ll think about long after you’ve left. I honestly would come back just for that one item.\nThey also offer a wide selection of baked goods, The coffee is consistently good too, which makes it a perfect pairing with any pastry. I also appreciate that everything feels fresh, and the presentation of the pastries makes it hard to choose just one. The place is great whether you want to sit inside and enjoy the calm atmosphere or grab something to take away while exploring Covent Garden.\nWhat’s exciting is that Chestnut Bakery also has another branch in Riyadh, so it’s great to see them bringing their unique style and quality to different parts of the world.\nIf you’re in Covent Garden and looking for a bakery that goes beyond the usual, I highly recommend Chestnut Bakery.",
