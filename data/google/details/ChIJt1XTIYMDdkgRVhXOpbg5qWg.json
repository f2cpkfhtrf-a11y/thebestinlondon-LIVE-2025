The amount and quality of food was astonishing! We received a plate stacked with meats and rice and veggies— all delicious! My favorite was the chicken wings as they were both flavorful and crispy. I didn’t enjoy the beef or goat too much as it was a bit too gamey for me but other people in my party enjoyed it. The hummus portion was a bit small but it was 10/10 with the bread that was served alongside. The salad and dipping sauces were tangy and very enjoyable. We were able to eat our food as the staff closed up around us and we left by 11:30pm just because we didn’t want to stay too long as they were closing— they were still taking walk in wrap orders as we left. Overall, the staff was welcoming and kind and the meal was delicious. Would recommend but maybe come a few hours before closing as the area is a bit sketchy at night.",
