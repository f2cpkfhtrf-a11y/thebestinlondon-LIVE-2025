But as we added a few extra items after our initial order, his attitude completely changed. He became noticeably annoyed and quite rude.\n\nWe politely asked for some extra fries (we are obviously paying for), which seemed to really set him off, and the whole vibe of the evening shifted.\n\nIt became so uncomfortable that we just paid the bill and left—didn’t even end up cutting the cake. The food was average at best, nothing memorable.",

We got serval starters, I can’t recall the names but one was a hot cheese pastry, meat sambosa, tabouleh, lamb chops, mixed grill and hummus and dessert. We were so focused on the food that I only remembered to take a photo right at the end hehehe and that desert was also great. You gotta come !",

We were a party of 5 and we could enjoy some delicious options to start with: delicious hummus with fine olive oil, fattoush salad with some pomegranate and sumac sprinkled around, lovely green and warm falafels (I’m a big fan of green falafel, but also enjoy yellow falafel occasionally) served with tahini, and some warm pitta. We continued with a few types of chicken dishes and fish, for main courses, which were very well made, but also quite big, we almost couldn’t finish.\nWe couldn’t stay long so we skipped the deserts, but they still treated us with lovely baklava, to finish our meal with something sweet.\nGreat place! Great food! We will surely return :)",
