It has a menu to suit all tastes and although everything is vegan, (thank you) the food is so tasty, any non vegan could have a really good meal here without any concerns over lack of choice. The service is excellent, the staff are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about all of the dishes. I had the Jamaican jerk chik'n which was exactly the right level of spicy and came with rice and peas, while my husband had a burrito with peri peri chips.\nIt was great value for money as the food is excellent and really good sized portions. My only complaint, I don't live closer!",

I'm not sure how the chefs do it, but they work magic into their food. We've tried most of the menu and always loved everything, but the wings are a real wow! If you can tolerate heat go for the Siracha and you won't be disappointed. Also love the jewelled rice, the butter chick*n, and the pad Thai. Milkshakes are good too.",

As someone who has eaten a lot of vegetarian and vegan food, I really really enjoyed this dish. It was so flavorful and so filling. All pieces of the dish were tasty, from the rice and beans, the goat curry, the green beans, and the plantains. The plantains even had a nice little crisp to them on the edges! I would definitely come back here the next time I’m in Camden Town. Outside seating is great as well. Perfect for people watching, which I enjoy as well. Highly recommend!",

I got a pad thai, which was nice enough, but a bit greasy, and my hubby got the hotdog, which had way too much sauce on it and a hard bun, which had clearly been microwaved, it was hard as a rock at the ends.\n\nAlthough the restaurant wasn't very busy, the service was minimal, we weren't checked during our meal, and the drinks came after the food - definitely would not have left a 12.5% tip if I had been asked.\n\nWhen I went to pay, the card machine gave service charge options, and the server quickly clicked 12.5% (so quickly I didnt even see, and I was paying). My husband told me after we left, so I didn't go back. This really shouldn't happen in the UK, where tipping is completely optional, especially when the service wasn't even friendly. That left a bad impression overall as it was very dishonest.",
