Few restaurants in London have managed to maintain such a consistent level of excellence over time. Every visit feels just as special as the first.\n\nFrom the moment you step in, the atmosphere envelops you: dim lighting, elegant music, and that signature balance of modern luxury and intimacy that only Hakkasan can create. The service is always refined yet relaxed, perfectly matching the restaurant’s understated sophistication.\n\nThe food remains absolutely outstanding. The crispy duck salad, the black truffle roasted duck, and the legendary pipa duck are on another level — perfectly cooked, flavourful, and beautifully presented. The dim sum selection and wagyu beef dishes are equally impressive, with every bite showing precision and artistry.\n\nOver the years, Hakkasan has never lost its magic. It continues to set the standard for contemporary Cantonese cuisine in London — a place where perfection feels effortless. Whether for a celebration or a quiet dinner, it remains one of my all-time favourites.\n\nSimply exceptional — from the duck to the cocktails, everything is top-tier.",

The environment was far from pleasant — the basement dining area was extremely noisy, with loud music and people shouting over each other. It felt more like a chaotic market than a restaurant.\nDespite the place not being full, the food took an unreasonably long time to arrive. When I asked about it, the waiter casually said the kitchen was busy. I ordered the second most expensive set menu, expecting a quality meal, but it was a complete letdown. None of the dishes were tasty or authentic. The roast duck and dim sum were just acceptable, but everything else was barely edible. At least three dishes were so unpleasant that we asked the waiter to take them away after just one bite. Most of the food was overly sour, strange, and unbalanced — the so-called “champagne honey fish” even tasted rotten.\nWhen we told the waiter that the food really wasn’t to our taste and asked for the dishes to be removed, he simply took them turned away without any reaction. The service throughout the meal was slow and indifferent. And to make matters worse, they still added a 15% service charge.\nOverall, it was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I’ve ever had — poor food, poor service, and a completely unpleasant atmosphere.",

Inside, the wonderfully decorated space, bathed in dim lighting, offered a convenient bag and coat check. The front desk staff provided a warm greeting, and since we were early, we had the option to sit at the bar or proceed to our table. Naturally, I checked out the bar, which was pleasant with good service.\nDescending the stairs, past the nicely segregated dining areas, it was impossible not to notice how busy and well-organized the venue was. At our table, the waiting staff introduced themselves and presented menus, including various options (if you're on a budget, it's wise to plan your meal in advance). The service was good, though there was a little room for improvement. The food, however, was excellent and cooked to perfection.\nAs I had mentioned it was a special occasion when reserving and confirming, our dessert arrived with a lovely personalized touch, which was much appreciated. Overall, we felt we got what we paid for, and I would highly recommend it.",
