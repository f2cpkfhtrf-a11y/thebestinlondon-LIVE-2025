The service was polite and courteous, though we caught them just as the kitchen was closing and they were setting up for the evening, so we may have not got the best of their attentions. Already looking forward to going back and trying the full tasting menu.",

The ambiance had a charming mix of elegance and warmth, making it perfect for a relaxed afternoon. The service was attentive without being overbearing, which added to the comfort.\n\nThe food was beautifully presented—fancy yet rooted in Indian flavors, giving the whole spread a unique twist. Every bite felt fresh and thoughtfully crafted.\n\nNow, here’s an unpopular opinion—I’m not really a chai person. Instead, I opted for a citrus chamomile tea, which was refreshing, light, and soothing. My friend went with the classic chai, and I have to admit—it smelled heavenly and tasted amazing too.\n\nIt is on the pricier side, but the overall experience makes it worth it—great food, lovely drinks, and a calm, welcoming atmosphere. I’d definitely recommend it if you’re looking to indulge in a refined afternoon tea with an Indian touch.",

The wine list is built to match the food. I had the prawn chimichi started and the fish curry as a main. The food was cooked to perfection and full of flavour. My waiter, Rony, was attentive, smiley and seemed genuinely pleased to be serving my table. I used to manage restaurants and he is sort of person I would have employed in a heartbeat, a true example of what hospitality should be.\n\nThe restaurant was busy as well, on a Monday! Which made for a great atmosphere.  Lots of happy diners and a really nice dining room with perfect lighting and lovely decor.\n\nI don’t live in London, but the next time I’m back here I will be making a beeline for Colobel Saab!",

The décor tells a story — rooted in Indian heritage yet stylishly curated — and it instantly sets the tone for what’s to come.\n\nThe food ranges between flawless and truly mind-blowing. Classics like the butter chicken are executed to perfection, while surprising dishes such as the broccoli with cheese starter stand out as memorable highlights. Every plate feels carefully thought through.\n\nService is impeccable: attentive without ever being intrusive. The staff gave just the right amount of time to make decisions, and service flowed seamlessly, with plates arriving and leaving exactly when they should.\n\nThe cocktails deserve their own spotlight. Signature drinks are not only beautifully presented but also pair remarkably well with the dishes — a rare balance of taste and detail. Even the non-alcoholic options were crafted with the same level of care.\n\nOverall, Colonel Saab is a restaurant I would recommend to anyone. It’s a place I’ll gladly return to every time I’m in London. Add to that the fact that the prices feel fair for the quality delivered, and you have a true gem worth experiencing.",

This restaurant came highly recommended by one of her colleagues.\n\nEntry to be greeted by many awards & trophies is a promising sight. Interior is nice with lots of characterful Indian touches & memorabilia on the walls.\n\nWe both sampled the tasting menu at £80 _each_. Wherever there was an option of choice we had both between us and shared.\n\nThroughout the meal, our waiters would give us a geographical & culinary history of the dishes as they arrive. A fantastic meal, every plate, bowl & morsel was ravenously consumed.",
