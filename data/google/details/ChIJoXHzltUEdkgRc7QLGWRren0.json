A special mention to Karolina at the front desk: even though we didn’t have a booking, she kindly found us seats at the bar and later welcomed us warmly to a table as soon as one became available. The premium beer and margarita were both fantastic. I’d give this place 5 stars and will definitely be returning.",

Your next best chance is around 18:30 to 19:00 when the first people with happy tummies start leaving.\n\nEither ask for recommendations or choose what you fancy. Pan Tomate was absolutely delicious, and so was the Mackerel. The Cuttlefish pappardelle were lovely too. Well, everything was good. Cremoso de Chocolate at the end was a fantastic finish.",

We were sat at the counter and ordered similar dishes as the group of 3 next to us. Yet from the time stamps on our photos, we were only served 2 lukewarm (albeit tasty) croquetas in the 45min from placing our order. We didn’t want to complain but eventually when one of the staff asked if everything was ok we replied honestly that we were hungry. The group next to us had received 4 dishes in that time including the tortilla and octopus which we had also ordered. He then told us that these dishes take time as they are made on the spot - no apology or I’ll check with the chef but the implication that we were impatient - this seemed not in keeping with any good customer service much less Michelin starred. The second dish (arroz negros) eventually came in nearly an hour from when we ordered, which understandably is a dish that might longer to cook but we had also ordered a gem lettuce side and tortilla etc that could have staved off our hunger in the meantime. The food was delicious although a tad salty and all chefs were working hard if inefficiently. They seemed to make one dish at a time despite multiple orders of the same being made and then the dish will go on a little journey up the counter to be garnished then down the counter to be dressed then around again as they looked whose dish it was for - which probably explained why some dishes ended up being lukewarm. I really loved the dishes but feel underwhelmed by the service for the price and how delays were handled. Eventually when he realised we hadn’t received our tortilla after more than an hour our wait staff apologised. We didn’t feel appreciated as customers and probably won’t go back as we’ve had better service with same level of food at Barrafina.",
