With the premium lunch you get a filet of steak which was lovely and tender but was not a great portion and the peanut sauce for the starters salad could do with a lot more seasoning. Otherwise I loved the service and great spot for amazing quality sushi in London !!",

The service lacked a bit of attention, the food arrived before the wine we ordered and we had empty wine glasses a couple of times and had to wait to refill them, the second bottle of wine I was not asked to try, being a new bottle I think it is normal to have it tried before serving and also no one did a check after the food was served. Also the wine was not opened in front of us and I think it is only fair to open the bottle in front of the customer. But overall it was a good experience . Highly recommended !!!",

I had booked in advance and arrived slightly early, so was asked to go grab a drink at the bar (which was full), so went across the street to Ivy instead. We arrived back at Roka about 5 minutes before our reserved time slot. We were told to wait a bit longer which is fine since we were slightly early. After 10 minutes I reminded the staff we were still waiting, he acknowledged and said he would be back to take care of us, this never happened. After standing around and waiting a total of 25 minutes past our reservation time slot and seeing customers who were behind us in line get seated, we asked to speak to the manager who asked us to wait another 5 minutes. We then saw some of the staff clear off the table which were then given to us. We were frustrated at that point, but since our friends had been raving about the place we decided to try and enjoy the rest of our evening. The experience after we were seated was not good at all, it was a busy night and service felt chaotic, inattentive and rushed. We were hoping the food was going to be the redeeming factor, but we were overall very disappointed. The food was not bad...but not great, just mediocre and for the prices they charge it was just not worth it. Would not recommend this place as there are many other great choices around this area.",

They took forever which dampened the experience.",

I’ve always loved the ambiance, the buzzing atmosphere, and the consistently great service.\n\nHowever, during my most recent visit, I did notice a slight drop in the quality of some of the dishes I’ve regularly ordered over the years. It’s a little disappointing, especially when you’ve come to expect a certain standard from a place you love. It does raise the question of whether it’s a one-off or something that needs attention.\n\nThat said, the overall experience was still enjoyable. The vibe and service were as great as always, and I’m hopeful the food will bounce back to what it used to be.",
