The food was seriously yummy, the place itself was gorgeous, and the people working there were mostly nice.\n\nBut, and it's a big but, the wait times were just awful. We got there maybe five or ten minutes early, but still had to hang around for like twenty minutes before our table was even ready.\n\nAfter we finally seated by staff, it took another 20minutes for our drinks to show up.\n\nI get that Sundays can be crazy busy, you know? But, we waited, get this, 50 to 60minutes for our food to come after we ordered! That meant we didn't eat until about an 1hrs and a half after we were supposed to.\n\nIt was especially tough with a 5year old child with us. The only reason they gave us was that the steak needed to be cooked, which is the most hilarious excuse I’ve had for a long wait for a meal, and I didn't really buy that, to be honest.\n\nBasically, we liked the food and the vibe, it’s a bit pricey for a Sunday roast, but the long waits made us feel a little… unappreciated, I guess.\n\nIt's a real pity, because it could have been a fantastic experience.",

As nice as it was, it unfortunately didn’t quite live up to expectations.\n\nNice welcome and lovely server. Order was taken quick enough and the trio of meats was served fairly quickly too. However, the chicken was dry and the lamb and beef were tough. Shining light was the roast potatoes and chocolate mousse for dessert. But for the price, I’d expected better and we kept having to ask for our Prosecco to be topped up! The waitress who initially served us seemed to be rushed off her feet.",
