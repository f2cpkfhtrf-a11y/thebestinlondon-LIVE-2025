However, the dining experience was let down by the extremely slow and inattentive service.\n\nWe had to wait over 10 minutes just to get tissues, and every time we tried to get the staff’s attention to order something, they would see us but ignore and kept doing their chores, which wasted a lot of time and really affected the overall experience.\n\nWhat was more disappointing was that despite the lacklustre service, the staff still expected a generous tip, which didn’t feel justified given how we were treated.\n\nI hope the management works on training the staff to be more attentive and responsive, because the food is genuinely good and the place has potential.",
