The d√©cor is lovely and feels authentic ‚Äì I‚Äôd give five stars for atmosphere.\n\nUnfortunately, the service didn‚Äôt live up to expectations. We visited during a quiet Sunday lunchtime with only two other tables occupied. The waiter seemed disinterested and inattentive. We ordered a bottle of sparkling water but weren‚Äôt given any glasses. We also had to ask for knives with our starter and call the staff over whenever we needed anything. For a high-end restaurant during a quiet period, I would expect the service to be far more attentive. One staff member who came by later was friendlier and asked about our meal, which was appreciated, but overall the service fell short.\n\nThe food was good, but the portion sizes were underwhelming for the price. The most disappointing dish was the Padang Thai beef curry ‚Äì the portion was so small it didn‚Äôt even cover a bowl of rice. It was also served on a small plate rather than in a bowl, which was surprising for a curry.\n\nOverall, a beautiful place with potential, but service and value for money need improvement.",

The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, and the service was top-notch. The staff were really attentive, especially Tia, who went out of her way to make sure we were looked after.\n\nThe drinks menu was great‚Äîlots of options. We went for mocktails, which were refreshing and well made. Starters were a hit too; the corn cakes and dumplings were especially tasty.\n\nThe mains came out fairly quickly, and everything was nicely cooked. We had the red chicken curry, glass noodles with prawns, Penang curry (though I was meant to get prawns and ended up with chicken, they swapped it for me but I had to wait a little so double check your dish before diving in!), and duck in sauce. The coconut rice was a standout for me - really fragrant and creamy. Just a heads-up: rice has to be ordered separately.\n\nIt was a birthday dinner, and they surprised us with a complimentary little chocolate cake and ice cream, which was a lovely touch.\n\nThe only downsides were the duck dish, which didn‚Äôt look the most appetising (though it tasted okay), and the fact there are no male toilets - just urinals.\n\nAlso one thing to note ‚Äì no one asked about allergies when we ordered, so it‚Äôs worth mentioning any dietary requirements upfront just to be safe.\n\nOverall, it was a really enjoyable evening with good food and excellent service.",
