However the salad was simple, just punch of vegetables, and the rice was alright. The bread was amazing and remarkable, we asked them to give us some more bread for takeaway, and they gave it to us for free!, which was really nice from them.\nThe restaurant was clean and there was attention to details, for example the bathroom soap seems to be from an expensive brand. The staff were nice with us.",

In terms of hospitality and staff, it’s definitely a five-star experience.\n\nHowever, we were a bit disappointed with the value for money. We ordered two starters and one main dish, and although the food was decent in taste, the portion sizes were very small – even for starters. The main dish was also quite minimal, and considering the prices, the portions felt overpriced.\n\nThe quality of the food was good, but not exceptional – for example, the cooking level wasn’t perfectly on point. So overall, while the service was excellent, the food experience didn’t quite justify the price tag.",

They took great care of each dish, from 24-30 hour marination of the best cuts of meat to delicately presenting it when serving. The food blew us away and lived up to the hype. We were well looked after by Jacob upon arrival who explained the concept and preparation of the dishes. Whilst Ali, went out his way to make us feel hospitable and looked after our children which was quite welcoming - making us want to come back.\n\nIf you're in Knightsbridge, make sure to eat something here.
