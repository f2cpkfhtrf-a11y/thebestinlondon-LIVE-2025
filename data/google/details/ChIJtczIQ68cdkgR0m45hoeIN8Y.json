The coffee is reliably good, but the hot chocolate is easily the best I’ve had — rich, smooth, and comforting. I’ve tried a few dishes here; the minced lamb with mint yogurt was a favourite, though it’s not on the menu anymore. That said, I don’t mind the seasonal changes — keeps things fresh. I had the burger this time and it was really tasty and satisfying.\n\nThe atmosphere is relaxed and not too busy, making it a great spot for a proper catch-up with a friend. It’s also perfect for an early morning pick-me-up. Whether you’re after a hearty breakfast or a filling lunch, Ozone has you covered. Definitely one of my go-to cafés in the area.",

It's a chain so there are a few others in various parts of London, but by this one in Shoreditch knocks the others out of the park. It was so good that I went there twice on back to back days that I stayed in Shoreditch area.\n\nThe food was great! I got the brunch menu that they have on weekends and the lunch menu that they have on weekdays (went on both Sunday and Monday). Portions are a bit small compared to America, but for London standards, it was very good.\n\nI don't remember exactly the food we got but the scrambled eggs and sausage was on point. The lamb meat thing on the bread was on point. The mushroom thing was also on point. The kombucha and the latte was also on point. So good so good.\n\nJust letting you know that there are only two restaurants I went twice in London. Dishoom and this place. If you somehow come by this place, its a good place to go. It's not like a must go place necessarily, but still very very good.",

Very filling.\n\nI’m not vegan but I try my best to always order vegan when I’m out and this hit all the levels needed. Full of flavour with a bit of spice, if you don’t want the spice just move some of the sauce away but it’s really good.\n\nI also got a Aperol Spritz & a juice, I always have to order two drinks. Complimentary water.\n\nI was able to bring my chihuahua and he just sat on he’s coat beside me, got some work done on my laptop.\n\nThere is certain times that you can sit and eat so make sure to check out the timings. But other times you can still get hot or cold drinks.\n\nDefinitely will be back, cosy warm and comfortable.",
