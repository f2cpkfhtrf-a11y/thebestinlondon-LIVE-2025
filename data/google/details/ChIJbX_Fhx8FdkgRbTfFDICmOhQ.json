We reserved in advance (which I recommend doing as it gets busy!) and they had actually read my booking notes. In the notes I mentioned I was pregnant and so they double checked I was happy with the preparation and ingredients of certain dishes. The menu leans towards the spicy and salty side, but at the same time is very fragrant and aromatic. Quite addictive really! I’ve seen viral videos of that Tom Yam deluxe noodle dish so obviously we had to get it. It was delicious, but to my surprise, my favourite dish was their Naem fried rice. It’s been about a week since our visit and I’m still licking my lips thinking about it. To top everything off, we got a surprise scoop of taro ice cream. How adorable is that? Lots of love to Speedboat. We’ll be back, and definitely before our next anniversary!",

Don’t get me wrong it was nice and tasty but just a little inconsistent and not insane value. The rice was overcooked and actually clumped together which I wouldn’t expect from a Thai restaurant- especially when paying £4 extra.. the purple aubergines were really nice, tender and flavourful. However for £12.50 I got one long purple aubergine- eight pieces. Would’ve said id happily pay £9, as it wasn’t mind blowing but very very nice. Would’ve been nicer with better rice. Good spice level, even though we received warning it was actually perfect. Channah got crispy egg noodles with gravy pork and squid and was pleasantly surprised with two different types of squid and she said good value for the amount of squid, as she’d expect more pork and less squid but it was the other way round. The spice also could’ve been higher and she wanted more greens in the mix and garnish. She really enjoyed though and felt it was good value for central London £17. Staff are possibly a bit overworked and overwhelmed but they are all so lovely. Happy to have come but wouldn’t rush to come back.",

First of all, I would like to thank the patient waiters and their drinks are good. However, what puzzles me is that the pricing of your restaurant's dishes is like a joke with customers. Your specialty dish \"yum pot\" is priced at 29 pounds. In fact, it is pitifully small and the contents are only some fried pork and convenience-based bargains, and a bowl of small rice costs 4 pounds. In addition, as for your taste, as an Asian, I can responsibly tell other consumers that the taste level of your food has only reached the middle and lower reaches. Then, your dining environment focusses on the style of \"market flavour” and \" street food\", so your dining environment is actually pitiful. Finally, in short, you don't have the dining environment and service experience of a high-class restaurant, and you don't make the food delicious. Overall, you have only achieved the level of 8 pounds per person. I don't understand why you have such a high Google rating.",

The only thing is it gets so crowded even the staff seem stressed with the hot plates darting around people. I wouldnt come back on a Thursday-Saturday night. Because it was so crowded I think the staff felt overwhelmed.\n\nIf it wasnt crowded I wouldve had a better experience for sure as the food was pretty good and the vibe was cool!
