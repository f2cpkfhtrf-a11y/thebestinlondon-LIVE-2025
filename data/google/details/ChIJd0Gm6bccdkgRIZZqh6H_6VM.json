Everyone who works there is in acting mode so it would be your best bet to also act like someone who is actually in jail.\n\nI was talking back and getting sassy because I feel like that would just be me if I was in jail.\n\nWhat school as they bring crazy scenarios to life, like there is a rebel that’s locked up with us and she’s trying to escape. So she comes around and asks who wants to escape with her and gives us a plan.\n\nAll while you have the warden and other security guards, walking around arguing with each other, people, yelling, people screaming.\n\nJust be ready to improv, and they are absolutely ready for you.\n\nIf you want to drink, you will have to “sneak ink your sealed bottle and the bartenders will make drinks for you, there is no bar. You will get four rounds total, and while you’re in jail, it’s called chicken soup. Whatever’s left over from your bottle, will be given back to you. I guess that’s one way to ensure you going home lit.. 😂",

You need to bring your own bottle of sealed alcohol and I presumed you would have to try harder to smuggle in your alcohol. The cocktails they make you are fantastic and delicious. It would have been good to have more than four drinks or a game to get access to additional drinks. It would be more fun to make it harder to break out of prison at the end. Despite it being good fun, it did feel like it was a lot of money for what you get. I would recommend going in groups of 6 so you can all sit together in a cell and make it a fun group experience.",
