The staff were welcoming, friendly and informative.\n\nü•©We ordered a platter of 3 steak cuts and they were all better than the last! Perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nüç§The prawn tempura starters were tasty while leaving room for the steak. But lacking in presentation.\n\nüçπMocktails were absolutely delicious and ice cold.\n\nüç®Desserts could be more elevated too. The tiramisu served in a flowerpot was theatrical but not that amazing.\n\nA nice interior but the seating style and table could be a little more elevated.\n\nI will be visiting again for the steak. The other menu items could be more tasty and better presented.",

Number 1 being that the servers recommend how the Wagyu should be cooked. And number 2 being that we are provided with a hot plate to do the cooking ourselves.\n\nOur first experience of Wagyu hit both of the above points. The meat was only briefly seared when it was brought out to us and the server recommended that we cook each side for a maximum of 5 seconds. This resulted in the most incredible steak we've ever had.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the steak here was still very nice. It didn't move us as much as we were expecting. The accompanying Steak Chips and Mocktail were both lovely. We were just slightly let down by the Steak.\n\nService on the whole was exceptional. Really nice and attentive staff. They even moved us to a nicer spot once it became free. We will give this place another shot next time we're in London.",

The moment you walk in, you‚Äôre greeted with a warm welcome and the place instantly feels special. The atmosphere is classy but still comfortable, with beautiful lighting and a lively vibe that makes you want to stay for hours.\n\nThe food? Absolutely incredible. The steak was cooked exactly how I wanted juicy, tender, and full of flavour. The sides were fresh and perfectly seasoned, and every bite felt like it was made with real care. The presentation was also on point every plate looked like something from a high-end magazine.\n\nThe drinks deserve their own shoutout. I had one of the best mocktails I‚Äôve ever tasted full of flavour, refreshing, and presented so beautifully it was almost too pretty to drink (almost!). It paired perfectly with the meal and made the whole experience even better.\n\nService was outstanding attentive without being pushy, and they made sure everything was just right for us. You can tell the staff take pride in making customers happy.\n\nOverall, Elvet Steakhouse isn‚Äôt just a place to eat it‚Äôs an experience. Perfect for a special night out, a celebration, or just treating yourself to something amazing. I‚Äôll 100% be coming back!",
