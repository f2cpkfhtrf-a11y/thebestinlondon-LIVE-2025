The tempura prawns were great and I don’t even like tempura.  I might be a tempura fan now!!  Also, the beef fillet was very good!!\n\nWe had drinks after dinner and had a blast.  The dirty martinis were on point and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  We would definitely go back!!",

Shame about the service, our waiter, Romanos, didn't pay much attention to us and everytime he served us he had a look on his face that he didn't want to be there. I kept having to waive my hand in the air to get him to serve us and one time even had to get up, for such a nice establishment, it should happen. We didn't bother staying for dessert because of this but I would definitely want to return as the food was top class and we had pleasant interactions with other staff. We ordered the Gochuchang Chicken, black cod, yellow tail sashimi and the prawn rendang and all those dishes were amazing. Would definitely recommend!! The statue in the washroom is hilarious BTW 🤣",

The team went above and beyond to make our day feel special, despite it being a spontaneous visit. The staff were attentive, gracious, and genuinely warm, making us feel celebrated and well taken care of throughout.\n\nAnd the food absolutely exceptional. Each dish was a burst of flavour, beautifully presented and perfectly balanced. Everything felt refined yet full of personality. Ivy Asia truly knows how to blend flair with authenticity.\n\nThe atmosphere was just right for the occasion stylish, vibrant, and with that signature Ivy touch of elegance. The attention to detail, from décor to service, made it a meal to remember.\n\nWe couldn’t have asked for a better way to mark our anniversary. Thank you to the amazing team at Ivy Asia, Mayfair for turning a last-minute plan into a truly memorable celebration. We’ll definitely be back next time, with a reservation in advance!",

The service was friendly and attentive, and the overall quality of the Asian cuisine was outstanding—definitely one of the better spots in London for this type of food. The jasmine rice was slightly dry and harder than expected, which was a minor letdown. I didn’t try the sushi this time, but I’m looking forward to sampling it on my next visit.",
