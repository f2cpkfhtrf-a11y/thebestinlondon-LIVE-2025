We booked in advance, and it was packed when we arrived.\n\nBetween us, we shared:\nIzakaya - tenderstem broccoli, edamame, wagyu beef tataki, crispy fried squid, Okonomiyaki prawn toast\nRaw - seared salmon sashimi\nHot Stone - sukiyaki wagyu beef, pulled lamb\nRobata - grilled salmon fillet\nDessert - kinako French toast\n\nThe salmon dishes were the standouts - perfectly cooked and full of flavour. I’m more of a savoury person, but even I loved the French toast. The broccoli and lamb were also really solid picks. Overall, the food was good.\n\nUnfortunately, the experience let it down. We were seated next to a loud table who arrived after us but were served first, and they spent the evening shouting across the table. Our drinks took 25 minutes to arrive, and we had to ask multiple times - even though we could see them sitting at the bar. We were also served the wrong dishes more than once and had to chase missing items. At the end, we were even given the wrong bill.\n\nI get that it was busy, but the service felt chaotic throughout, with no apology or effort to make up for it.\n\nGlad we tried it, but I probably wouldn’t go back. For the price, we expected a better overall experience.\n\n—\n\nEdit: despite a comment on this review asking me to get directly in touch i’ve since emailed the provided address and received no response",
