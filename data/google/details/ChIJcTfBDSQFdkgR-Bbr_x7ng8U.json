I have to admit, I’m not the biggest fan of Italian food in general (even though I consider myself a foodie), so I’ll be a bit subjective there. But where I can be objective is in how the food was cooked, presented, and tasted.\n\nMy partner had the pasta, which was freshly made and tasted good, but it didn’t exactly blow her away – just a nice, decent dish. I had the steak, which was a premium cut, not a cheap one, but unfortunately it came out cold. It also wasn’t cooked perfectly to medium rare. It was still edible, and when the waiter asked how it was, I mentioned it was “good but cold” – though she ignored the second part and didn’t follow up or offer a solution.\n\nThe kids’ meal was generous, well-priced, and definitely one of the highlights. Cocktails were decent, and the service overall was polite and friendly. The restaurant itself was busy and felt a bit cramped – I assume they’ve added more tables to increase seating, which is understandable.\n\nWe only visited because we had a voucher, and while the overall experience was okay, if we had paid full price, I wouldn’t feel it was worth it. Just not somewhere I’d choose to come back to, unfortunately.",
