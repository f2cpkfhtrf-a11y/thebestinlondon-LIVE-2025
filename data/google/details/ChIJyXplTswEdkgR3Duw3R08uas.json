We added mushroom sauce, peppercorn sauce, and another one with wine that I can’t remember the name.\n\nThe seasoning on the steaks was nice, and the meat was good quality, but nothing that really wowed me. Overall, the whole experience was cute and different, and it was my first time trying this kind of place, but I probably wouldn’t go back.\n\nIt was a bit expensive to be honest, and the steak doesn’t come with anything – you have to add the sauce, chips or mash separately. Also, the stone gets cold halfway through, and I wasn’t really in the mood to ask for a new one since it’s a bit awkward to handle.\n\nThe staff were nice and friendly, and even when we arrived late, the lady in charge of bookings was really kind and accommodating.\n\nOverall, I think it’s a bit overhyped considering how it’s always fully booked. Actually you can even ask for your steak to be done by the chef in the kitchen but Personally, I’d rather go to another steakhouse next time and honestly, why am I cooking it myself when I’m paying that much.",
