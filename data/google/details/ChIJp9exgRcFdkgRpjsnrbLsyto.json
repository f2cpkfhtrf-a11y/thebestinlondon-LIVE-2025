Its been a while I had good Gluten free cake.\nHighly recommend this place .\nThanks Siniya for making this dining experience so pleasant.",

The service is quite good — if they’re busy, you can leave your phone number, have a little wander, and they’ll call you when your table is ready, which is a brilliant idea. On the other hand, it sometimes feels like there aren’t quite enough staff inside; we were forgotten once and ended up paying at the bar after waiting a while for someone to bring the card machine.\nMarcus tea looks lovely and tastes great if you’re a fan of chamomile, and the smoothies are excellent. Portion sizes are fairly standard. The Eggs Benedict wasn’t bad, though the mustardy flavour isn’t typical and not really to my taste — but that’s just a matter of preference. The shakshuka, however, was very nice.",

The food is delicious and the staff were all super friendly.\nI knocked it down a star because of a few details.\nWe received one dish a long time before the others. It was a side dish, not a starter, so I'm not sure why this came out so early. Luckily it wasn't hot.\nAlso, towards the end of our meal, the staff became very inattentive. They cleared away our plates, asked if we wanted the dessert menu, we said yes, but didn't receive a menu for over 15 minutes. We had to ask a second time.\nTheir card reader didn't work, so they asked us to scan a QR code to pay instead. We both would have preferred to pay by the machine, so this was a little disappointing.\nOverall, it was lovely and I'd definitely recommend, but I think there's some fine tuning on timings that could improve the overall experience.",
