The customer service was excellent, and the course menu we tried had some good dishes. However, there didn’t seem to be any real connection between each course — it felt as though each dish was created by a different chef who hadn’t spoken to the others.\n\nThe dessert was phenomenal, but again, it didn’t match or flow naturally with the rest of the meal. Overall, it was worth trying once, but I wouldn’t return.\n\nUnfortunately, this time the experience really fell short of my expectations. The waiter was overly enthusiastic and kept hovering around my table, which made me feel uncomfortable, as if I were being watched the whole time. The restaurant was also quite noisy.\n\nTo make matters worse, I even found hair in my food — which is unacceptable. Because of this, I don’t think I’ll ever come back.",

From the moment we arrived, we were warmly greeted by the reception team who kindly showed us to our table. The atmosphere was relaxed, welcoming, and had a lovely friendly vibe.\n\nMy friend is from Japan and has really missed authentic Japanese food, I was hoping to bring her a taste of home, and this place absolutely delivered. We both thoroughly enjoyed the food and the attentive service. The quality was outstanding, some of the best Japanese cuisine we’ve had in a long time.\n\nWe went for the 3-course meal and also tried a few dishes from the à la carte menu. Everything was beautifully presented and tasted incredible. I’d definitely come back and highly recommend it, especially if you’re a fan of sashimi!",

The beef was cooked beautifully, with good smoke flavour but the sauces failed to complement it. The sushi was good and fresh, and the dessert was also satisfyingly sweet. Where Niju falls short of the mark is being more innovative than any other high-standard Japanese restaurant, but I can attest to the quality they provide of the usual dishes.",
