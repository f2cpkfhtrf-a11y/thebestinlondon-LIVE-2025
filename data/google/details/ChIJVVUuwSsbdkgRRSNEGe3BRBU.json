The appetizers (snail and frog lollipop) and side dishes (pomme something) were extra costs, as tiny as the bouche amusee, not flavorful at all, and very greasy. The desserts were regular size and actually quite good. Drinks were okay…my sparkling wine had a tiny serving as well. Overall, would not recommend…for this price, you can get much better food elsewhere.",

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted warmly and shown to a our table.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious. Each dish was bursting with flavour, and you could really tell that everything was made with care and quality ingredients. We enjoyed a variety of appetizers, mains, and desserts, and each course was better than the last. We have tried the snail bon bons, frog's leg lollipops, petite gougeres, smoked eel, quail forestiere, saddle of rabbit and the veal. For dessert we had the Rhubarb vacherin and Paris Brest. Everything was 10/10!\n\nThe service was impeccable. The staff were attentive, friendly, and really went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. It was clear they were genuinely focused on providing an exceptional experience.\n\nWhat’s even more amazing is that I’ve been to this restaurant before, back in 2023 when they first opened, and even then, the food was absolutely amazing. It’s incredible to see how they’ve maintained such high standards and consistently delivered a fantastic dining experience. They definitely deserve their michelin star!\n\nAll in all, it was a fantastic experience, and I couldn’t have asked for a better setting to celebrate my mum's special day. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for spectacular food and top-notch service!",

However, I found the food to be average, not quite above my expectations. We had the lobster and steak as our main dishes; both were decent, but there was no surprise in terms of flavour. The starters were similar, not bad, but lacking in harmony and depth, and nothing particularly memorable. The courgettes we had were way too salty, to the point of being unpleasant.\n\nAt this price point, I was hoping for something either novel or a truly exceptional take on a classic. While it was a lovely evening overall, the food didn’t quite match what I’d expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant.\n\nThe desserts were the highlight of the meal. I particularly enjoyed the crème brûlée with prune, which was simple but well done. The strawberry mille crêpe was also delicious and nicely balanced.\n\nI probably wouldn’t return, but would still recommend it to someone looking for a stylish, intimate place to celebrate, especially if food innovation isn’t a top priority.",

The only struggle is deciding what to order because everything is genuinely delicious (especially the quail for starters is just ♡!)\nI brought my parents and brother today to celebrate their birthdays, and the team prepared three cards and three candles for us, such a thoughtful touch.\nThe service is always friendly and the vibe is cosy. For the price point in London, it’s 10/10. Can’t get enough of this place.\nSharing some of the photos from my past 4 visits!",
