They went above and beyond to make our family and guests feel at home, showing a level of kindness that touched all of us deeply. The ambience was warm, intimate, and filled with heart‚Äîthe kind of place that invites both comfort and connection.\n\nAs we arrived, we were moved to see a beautiful placard outside the restaurant displaying details of the event. It was such a thoughtful, respectful gesture. Inside, they had created a custom menu for the celebration of life and guests couldn‚Äôt stop commenting on how special and personal everything felt.\n\nAnd the menu‚Äîabsolutely outstanding. Guests raved about the food, each dish flavorful and prepared with care. It wasn‚Äôt just a meal; it was an experience that brought people together around the table.\n\nWe truly cannot thank Ali, Ege, and the entire team at BaBa Restaurant enough. Their attention to detail, their warmth, and their respect made what could have been a heavy day feel full of light, love, and remembrance. It was more than just a venue‚Äîit became part of our story.\n\nTo anyone looking for a place to gather, celebrate, or simply be surrounded by good food and good people: BaBa is a gem. And for us, it will forever hold a very special place in our hearts.",
