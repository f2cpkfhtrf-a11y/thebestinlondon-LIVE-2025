We were immediately met with smiles and kindness from the host and they were able to sit us about 10 minutes early. We were quickly brought drinks and popcorn which was so sweet and unexpected. Our server Alex was so fun, attentive, and full of energy even though it was late at night (we had a 10:15pm reservation)! He helped make our time such a joy. Alex was absolutely great and it was a pleasure to have him as our server. Even though it wasn’t the exact date of our birthdays, he kindly brought us prosecco to cheers with without us asking. We ordered steak, the chili pepper burger, and macaroni & cheese which were all delicious. The steak was perfectly cooked and the burger was juicy as ever. The macaroni was so good we ordered a second! The food came out quick and the prices were very affordable especially for a steakhouse—great for being on a budget!\nI would highly recommend this place and I wish we could come again during our stay!\nYou will be blessed if you happen to have Alex as your server!\nThank you Alex and Flat Iron!\nWe hope to be back!",

The drinks were surprisingly not expensive for the quality they were.The rose lemonade was straight up fantastic. The steak was perfectly cooked. The house dressing on the green salad was to die for. The photos do not do this place justice. You even get free ice cream on your way out. Without question this was our favorite restaurant and would highly recommend.",

Without reservations the wait was 30 minutes I heard the host telling a couple right in front of us.\n\nThe steak was delicious!!!! We had the Mac and cheese and the fries and they were both amazing.\n\nThe ice cream of this location is just superb ! What a great experience!\n\nIf you want to try the flat iron, try this location. We loved it so much that we went to another location, but the experience was not the same.\n\nThe only thing is, the tables are really close to each other and the table we were placed in the basement was in the middle of the passageway which bothered me a little that people kept passing by us all the time. Besides that, from the host to the server and the ice cream server all staff is friendly and polite !",

Was juicy, lightly salted with perfect bernaise and peppercorn sauces. Its such a bonus when so much care has been put into the sides. Delicious smoky aubergine, garlic bone marrow mash and fantastic mac n cheese. Cool refreshing drinks. salted caramel ice cream with crushed chocolate topping to finish. Excellent friendly service, reasonable prices. I hope they never get so busy I can't get a table when I want. I love this place. Its an easy go to when you just want a guaranteed great tasty meal.
