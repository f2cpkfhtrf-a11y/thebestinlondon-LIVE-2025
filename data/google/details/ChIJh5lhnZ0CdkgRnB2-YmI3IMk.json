The presentation was nice, and everything was fresh and well-cooked. The staff were friendly and gave great service.\n\nWe had our meal in the garden. It was beautiful and peaceful. There are special flowers in every season, and everything is very well cared for. We asked the owner, and he said his father takes care of the garden as a hobby. It was a lovely experience.",

I ordered the mixed kebab and sigama boregi which where all very lush, I like that the borek came with some chilli jam and the salad that came w the kebab had pomegranata which was refreshing. Cocktails are great too here, not too strong but also not a faint taste. Honestly, no complaints and I'd 100% return here.",

Went with some friends and we ordered the Turkish breakfast. The waiter took time to listen to our orders and requirements. The food didn’t take too long to come and was presented beautifully. The only thing that I would say could be improved were the eggs. I asked for runny yolks, not snotty, but they came overcooked. That’s the only thing I would say needed improvement. Nice low level of music in the background so you don’t have to talk loudly at all. Overall, a lovely experience.",
