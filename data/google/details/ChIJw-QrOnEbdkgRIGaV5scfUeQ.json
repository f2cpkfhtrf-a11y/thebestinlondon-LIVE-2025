The specialty cocktails were really cool and tasted great! The lychee martini was my favourite. They were a bit expensive but can be expected. We sat in the garden area as it was warm, and the music was a good vibe. It felt like we were on holiday in Greece. The wait staff were very attentive, and though we were waiting for a 2nd round of drinks for a bit longer than normal, they apologised and gave us free shots as compensation!! They also gave us more free shots and a sparkling candle for a birthday treat! This really made the experience as I didn‚Äôt ask for them to do this! It was a little expensive but you are also paying for the experience. Overall I would recommend for a celebration dinner!",

The pricing simply didn‚Äôt add up.\n\nPaying ¬£15 for a basket of bread and dips, the kind you‚Äôd be served complimentary at most Turkish restaurants in North London - was the tipping point. The food lacked freshness, flavour, and any sense of value. We had to ask for salt and pepper and even some cheese because the pasta we ordered lacked so much flavour. We left midway, opting to settle the bill and find dessert and shisha elsewhere.\n\nThis is a place built for photos, not for food. If you‚Äôre chasing aesthetics for Instagram, it delivers. If you‚Äôre chasing quality cuisine, look elsewhere. We left disappointed and won‚Äôt return.",
