The Menus where presented and very much like coffee table books, clear and well presented. We decided and ordered our dishes and drinks. They came out quickly and the food was fine. The only comment was that my dish Chicken Katsu Curry with Rice wasnt hot as I had wished, but it was fine. Everything else was well presented and tasty and met our expectations. I would say the food was fine, but again, London has multiple eateries that offer very much the same dishes at a similar price point. If you are in the area, them drop on in and give it a try. It is close to City of London and does a lot of the City folks as well as well as the Shoreditch Tech crowd. Enjoy, a nice eating experience.",

A special mention to the slim Chinese lady who brought us to our table and the young Japanese Guy from Mie! They even Brought out a complimentary dessert knowing it was my birthday. It was much appreciated 🍰😊. Food was needlessly to say very good also. Flavourful, presented well and value for money. We will be back!!",

We got the sashimi set, nigiri sushi set and unagi don each. The salmon was ok in the sashimi set but the other 2 were not good. Texture was rough and not smooth like a sashimi should have been. The quality was just not there. Nigiri was also quite unpalatable. I think this is because it wasn’t as fresh as it could have been. The only good thing was unagi don, of course not the best I’ve had but for the price it was ok. Also the staff don’t really say ‘irrasshaimase’ which kind of throws you off. It’s such a small word but it sets the tone in a true Japanese restaurant. It’s more than a greeting it’s part of the whole experience which I did not receive here.",

We enjoyed the lovely, cosy atmosphere and found the staff to be friendly and attentive. Drinks were served promptly, while the food took a little longer, likely due to the busy period. Desserts arrived quickly, and overall, we were very pleased with our experience. We will definitely be returning.",
