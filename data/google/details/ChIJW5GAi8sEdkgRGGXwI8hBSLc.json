Very pleasant experience overall.\n\nWe ordered the Royal Eggs with smoked salmon (similar to Eggs Benedict) and an English Breakfast. Everything was delicious, and the egg quality was excellent. I also had a lychee matcha — the matcha itself was great quality, just a bit too sweet for my taste (I’d ask for less sweetness next time). My husband ordered a coffee pot with milk, which was a very cool experience and great coffee quality too.\n\nOur server, a young woman named Tasha, was wonderful — super friendly and attentive. Highly recommend this spot if you’re looking for a great breakfast in the heart of London, not far from Big Ben!",

He was full of positive energy, very friendly, and incredibly polite. He really looked after us.\n\nFor food, we ordered the Fish & Chips and the Moroccan-style Chicken. The fish and chips were excellent, but the chicken wasn’t really to my taste as it had quite a strong curry flavour.\n\nFor dessert, we chose the Chocolate Bombe, which was delicious, and Carlos very kindly surprised us with an extra dessert on the house. That was such a thoughtful gesture and very much appreciated.\n\nOverall, it was a wonderful experience — many thanks to Carlos and the whole team for making our evening so enjoyable.",

From the moment we arrived, the hospitality was of the highest standard. The team, including both the waiters and managers, were attentive, professional, and genuinely warm, creating a welcoming atmosphere throughout our visit.\n\nWhat stood out most was the way they went above and beyond to ensure my girlfriend felt celebrated and special on her birthday. This thoughtful attention to detail made the occasion truly memorable. Even as we departed, the service remained impeccable, demonstrating consistency and care from start to finish.\n\nThe food itself was of outstanding quality beautifully prepared, flavourful, and presented with finesse. Combined with the excellent service, it made for a dining experience that exceeded expectations.\n\nI would highly recommend The Ivy Market Grill to anyone seeking not only delicious cuisine but also exemplary service and a refined yet welcoming atmosphere.",
