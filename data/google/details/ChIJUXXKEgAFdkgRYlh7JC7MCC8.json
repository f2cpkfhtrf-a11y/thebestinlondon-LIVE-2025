They’ve only been open six months. The Decorations of this restaurant is really nice. The service was excellent. We will return when our next trip to. I had great aprons that you put on when you’re having dinner makes a great picture  thought that was a really cute idea. Also, at the end they gave you this box with herbs in it. We tried it has an interesting taste",

The flavors, the service, the atmosphere, the cleanliness… everything was a 5 from us. I cannot even tell you what was my favorite because all of it was beyond delicious. Lovpreet took incredible care of us and guided us through a unique and flavorful journey via the menu. Just do the chef’s choice. You won’t be disappointed and you definitely get a lot of food, so come hungry. Also get a Masala chai tea. Ah-mazing.",

      "text": "Went to Oorja for their pre-theatre menu, and I’ll get the good thing out of the way first (there’s only one) - the food tastes really good, and their curries and starters have tons of flavour. That’s all!\n\nWhat spoils the experience is their service, with the staff’s general apathy and lack of interest in doing their job (for a 12.5% service charge that too). They seated us at an unprepared table - missing napkins and the table lamp (which customers must switch to call for service). We sat for 20 mins with no service, waiting for the menu, or being asked for water. We looked around and figured we were missing the lamp, and we had to grab one from an empty table nearby. Ironically, staff keep walking around to fix small bits-and-bobs on empty tables, but never really eye the customers.\n\nEven after finally placing an order, the service didn’t improve - we had different people tend to us at different times, as if they lacked coordination with each other.\n\nThe kicker to all this was at the end, when we asked someone from management to have the service charge removed. We whispered to him to have the charge removed so as not to embarrass the staff. But he took it personally, and shouted across the resto to his staff “hey remove the service charge and give this bill” - almost in a petty attempt to embarrass us. He had no questions to us to enquire what went wrong or what could be improved. Good luck showing that attitude.\n\nOverall, felt like the place was run by petty, rude, amateur and unprofessional people (as also evidenced by some of their other confrontational responses to low-rated Google reviews). And this attitude flows through to the staff.\n\nRight after we paid, one of the waiters promptly came and asked us to leave as they have another booking. They didn’t seem to care for the 20 mins we waited for the menus, or the time we waited for each of our courses.",

The service from everyone was warm and attentive, with special thanks to Lovely, the head of serving staff, who made us feel truly welcome. Amit’s cocktails were a real treat – beautifully made and just as tasty, definitely Kesariya is a great cocktail. With its charming atmosphere and all-round excellence, I’d definitely recommend this place and will gladly visit again.",
