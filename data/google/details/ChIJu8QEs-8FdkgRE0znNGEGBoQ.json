If this doesn't get another Michelin star this year I will eat my hat.\n\nWe've followed chefs Jason and Spencer for many years, particularly enjoying Spencer Metzger's journey on Great British Menu a few years ago and when I heard of this collaboration with Jason Atherton this flew to the top of my list.\n\nMy wonderful wife was able to secure a reservation for my birthday this year and my word what a great experience this proved to be.\n\nAs soon as you enter you are made to feel as though you are the only people in the restaurant, the space is elegant and intimate, as we entered it was incredible to see Spencer and the rest of the chefs right there preparing the meals in front of you. The choreography and elegance of the service was second to none. I thought we were just lucky to see Spencer for a short time but throughout the meal he was a presence overseeing the service and coming over to explain the dishes along with his personable and equally talented staff.\n\nEvery single course was sensational, not a single curio or slight miss. While we were excited to experience each course as it came we were almost wistful that the previous course had finished... Now time to find an excuse to return as soon as possible!",

      "text": "Row on 5 is one of the most anticipated restaurant openings in London recently, and expectations were understandably high given chef Jason Atherton’s success with Row on 45 in Dubai. We visited for a special Valentine’s Day dinner and had an overall memorable but mixed experience.\n\nThe evening begins with a tour of the venue – including the wine cellar, kitchen, and champagne room – before you're seated downstairs for the opening courses. The introduction is impressive and clearly influenced by Frantzén, which unfortunately becomes a recurring theme throughout the evening. Some dishes felt a little too inspired, bordering on imitation.\n\nStandout dishes included the langoustine claw, beautifully presented with engraved chopsticks (which we got to take home), and the main of sika deer, which was perfectly cooked and paired with thoughtful, sweet sauces. The seafood courses were strong and well-executed overall. That said, not all courses lived up to the same level — the use of tarts became repetitive, and a few bites (like the brioche and stilton tart) felt underwhelming being listed as an individual course, or oddly placed in the lineup.\n\nService was polished and professional, with personal touches that really elevated the evening — from engraved chopsticks to a personalised menu sealed with wax. It felt special. However, pacing was an issue. We waited too long between courses towards the end, with little communication from staff, and that disrupted the flow of the meal.\n\nThe wine list is massive — physically and in scale. While there’s a by-the-glass option available, the wine pairings felt overpriced, with “upgrades” on the cheaper pairings that came across as cheeky rather than premium. Charging £220 extra for a single dessert wine on a £145 pairing felt excessive.\n\nDesserts were good but again lacked consistency. The petit fours were fun to try, but too many tarts and sweets made the end of the meal feel repetitive and overly sweet.\n\nRow on 5 has all the elements of a top-tier fine dining experience — talented kitchen, high production value, polished service, and luxury touches — but it hasn’t fully found its identity yet. The team clearly has ambitions beyond their current 1 Michelin star, and with refinement, they could very well get there. For now, it’s a strong one-star experience with flashes of brilliance.\n\nWould I return? Possibly, in a year or two. They're still finding their voice. I have to mention that the £250 price tag is one of the most expensive dinners in London, and is of questionable value in my experience.",

      "text": "Simply overrated. The tasting menu was advertised for 15 courses, 5 of which were the sweets/dessert. It felt more like 1 snack (4 bites portion size served separately), 5 seafood/meat dishes, one-bite cheese, pre-dessert, dessert and petit four (multiple little gadgets). They raised my expectations too high, but the actual experience was what it really meant.\n\nMeat portion was tiny. Lamb dish was so small like scraps (tasted ok, just too tiny tiny to enjoy properly).  There was more sauce than the actual substance to eat. It is also noted that no textually identifiable vegetables were used in the tasting menu.\n\nI also felt culinary skills were rather limited for £250 tasting menu price point (price excluded drinks and service charges). But the presentation could easily hide the limitations.\n\nFor one course, it was presented by a server with a serious bad breath, likely caused by smoking or something else. It spoiled the dish from anticipation and the rest of the dinner. Sine then, I was hoping someone else came to present the remaining dishes.\n\nThe open kitchen was good for a show, but the restaurant flow had to be flawless, expecting every detail to be visible to the diners. Chefs were all very busy even the open kitchen was only serving 1/3 of the available dining area seating.\n\nFor instance, citrus zest was prepared using a grater and a scraper in a rush. The chef was brushing so hard and quick in a haste, and the zest didn't land on the food at all. Brushing off the zest with force would be more likely to miss your target food, making the ingredients on each serving inconsistent\n\nI chose the counter seating. Perhaps the \"corridor\" behind my seat was a bit tight. The server passed by to another table and scratched the back of the stool and my hair. I was fuming that he didn't even apologise as if he didn't feel the bump. Otherwise, the counter seating was a good option for solo or couple diners.\n\nNon-alcholic beverage selected was limited. Yuzu Collins didn't taste like the description provided, except a lot of soda water. Sigh\n\nI'd say 3 stars for Google review in general, but have to deduct one star taking into account they were charging £250 (tasting menu price excluding drinks and service charge) that was equivalent to other Michelin 2-star restaurant tasting menu price in London.",
