The ice cream with mixed berries was refreshing, though the berries themselves were quite sour. The shepherd’s pie was flavorful and satisfying, definitely a highlight of the meal. The pumpkin soup had a rich and creamy taste, very enjoyable.\n\nA lovely dining experience with great ambiance and good food.",

The decor of the restaurant was lovely although some of the furniture was starting to show signs of wear and tear. The staff were all lovely and the food was good and less expensive than one might think for such a location.  I felt the sausage and the black pudding lacked some seasoning although I appreciate that's personal taste and others would find them ok. All in all a good breakfast experience although I probably wouldn't rush back for breakfast.",

The Tempura Prawns were super crispy and full of flavour, and the Moroccan Chicken was honestly one of the best dishes I’ve had in a long time — so juicy and well seasoned!\n\nThe ambience was lovely too — I really liked the cosy yet elegant décor, which made the whole place feel welcoming and special. It’s the kind of spot where you can relax, enjoy your meal, and just have a good time.\n\nA big shoutout to Osman for his excellent service! He was so attentive, had great timing, and really made us laugh throughout the evening. It’s rare to find staff who make the experience feel so personal and fun.\n\nOverall, I’d definitely recommend Ivy to anyone looking for great food, a lovely atmosphere, and friendly service. Can’t wait to go back!",
