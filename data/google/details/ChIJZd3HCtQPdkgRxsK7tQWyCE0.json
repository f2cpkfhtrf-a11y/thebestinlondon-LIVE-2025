      "text": "Yesterday’s experience at the restaurant was unfortunately disappointing. I had been looking forward to visiting after hearing so many positive things about both the food and service. We were a group of five, with friends visiting from Belgium, and while the food itself did not disappoint in particular, the prawn tartare and ox cheek pasta were absolutely delicious. The service fell far short of expectations and ultimately spoiled the evening.\nTo highlight a few issues: water was never topped up unless we waved and asked, empty glasses were left on the table all night (on one occasion the waiter removed only a single glass and walked away without a word), and our mains were left sitting on the pass because we hadn’t been given cutlery. The manager had to step in to resolve this. There were no checkbacks on starters, and throughout the evening the waiter seemed disengaged and uninterested. At one point I even saw him throw something near the bar till and have what appeared to be a heated discussion with a manager. His lack of presence and professionalism really detracted from what should have been a memorable evening.\nTo add to the disappointment, when we left, the host didn’t even say goodbye. Small touches like this make a big difference, and their absence was noticeable.\nOverall, while the food was excellent, the service was nowhere near the standard I had been led to expect.",

Overall the experience was amazing and this is highly recommended. On top of that the area where the place is is beautiful and warrants a nice afternoon drive.",

Its open-concept kitchen isn't just for show; it genuinely invites you to witness the culinary magic, creating a wonderful sense of transparency and engagement. The service, particularly from Ondrej, was impeccable. He warmly greeted us with complimentary champagne to celebrate our anniversary, a lovely touch. We chose the Chateaubriand for two from their nightly specials board, and it was grilled and rested to absolute perfection. With a generous selection of wines and cocktails, we know we'll be back.",
