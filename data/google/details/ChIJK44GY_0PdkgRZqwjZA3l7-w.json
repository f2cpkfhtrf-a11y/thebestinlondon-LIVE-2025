We ordered a pot of fresh mint tea, a latte, and their famous hotcake. The ricotta hotcakes were incredible—super fluffy, not too sweet or greasy, and perfectly paired with caramelized bananas. Latte was fantastic as well. Service was excellent, with attentive and kind staff. Looking forward to coming back to try more of their dishes!",

They took our drink order and by the time the drinks & water came, we were ready to order. The table water was brought in a pitcher with 2 small cups, they filled them halfway which I was okay with thinking they'd leave the pitcher but that wasn't the case. This was also the last time we were served water. We promptly ordered and the food arrived relatively quickly. I asked for a condiment for my fries. The burger had a great flavor but the bun was either old or completely over toasted. So much so that it overtook the burger flavor which was a shame. The fries were not what I'd expect from a restaurant. I'm sure the side condiments would've helped had I received them before the entirety of my meal was completed. We also never saw another server again before having to go inside and ask for the ticket. The server apologized repeatedly for \"forgetting they had tables outside\" but didn't offer to make anything better. I'm not too terribly sure how they forget there are outdoor tables when they have very large windows at the front of the restaurant offering a view. All in all, unfortunately, I wouldn't return and would be hard pressed to recommend the experience to others.",
