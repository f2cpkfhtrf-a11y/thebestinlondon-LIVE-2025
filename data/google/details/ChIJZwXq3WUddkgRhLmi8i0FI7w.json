A very nice lunch which wasn't expensive. I can recommend and would use again.",

The big portion of pork ribs is huge, and ver meaty, but the unexpected dishes that won everybody over were the meatball starters, and the Mac and cheese side dish.\n\nSpecial thanks to the staff that served us. Cristina and Teo (? I might have his name wrong there, but I'm referring to the Albanian fellow.) were excellent, as was the manager there, and the lady at reception. If the restaurant offers any bonuses or commendations, I think they should be the ones to receive them. And as a disclaimer, they did NOT ask me to write a review or to mention them. I just thought they did an excellent job.\n\nSo, if you wanna dine fancy but not break the bank too much, this place has you covered.",

It was very nice, very good portion, I would give it 9 out of 10. I have only deducted one point because the chips clearly weren’t made in the kitchen, they were just from a packet.\nHowever, my daughter ordered the burger, to say it was dry was a understatement, it was really tasteless and not delicious at all. I would give it 5 out of 10 at best, this burger was not even as good as GBK. A big disappointment, Gordon you can do much better!!",
