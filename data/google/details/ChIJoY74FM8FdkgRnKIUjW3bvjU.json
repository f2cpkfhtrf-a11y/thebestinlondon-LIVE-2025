However, £18 for a few cherry tomatoes with buffalo cheese felt excessive, especially considering the portion size. The rest of the food was decent, but nothing that really stood out.\n\nA rather odd moment was when my friend’s small bottle of water, which was on the table, was taken away by the staff with the promise to keep it for her - only for it never to be returned.\n\nWhile the restaurant seems to aim for a fine dining experience, the details let it down. There were quite a few fruit flies around, and at one point a server (in a suit) actually had to catch one with a napkin while serving food - I had pointed it out, but still, not what you'd expect.\n\nOur waitress was pleasant, but service was quite slow, particularly when it came time to pay. When we asked to split the bill by exact amounts, she seemed visibly annoyed, which was disappointing.\n\nAs we left, neither of the two hostesses at the front acknowledged us - no goodbye, no thank you - they were too busy chatting with each other, despite clearly seeing us leave.\n\nWe did pay the 13.5% service charge, but honestly, it didn’t feel earned. While some dishes were enjoyable, overall the experience didn’t meet expectations, and I wouldn’t return. There are plenty of other places offering better food and service for the same price - or less.",

My date had a ball with the cold section though (had maybe 3 runs at it)\nI opted for the Lamb Sunday roast right after, that I kinda really enjoyed. It was good.\nThe desserts were half good, you could feel it had some potential to be much better.\n\nI was a bit concerned with some reviews regarding value, service, etc.\nThe Vibe is definitely amazing, live singer while you down prosecco is always an amazing feeling.\nI suppose if I was a cold cut person, I would have had much more fun. But yeah. So it would be somewhat disingenuous to knock it outright on the basis of \"Value\".\n(Suggestion: maybe add some plates of sautéed prawns, etc. Adds options without going out of the way.)\nThe service was a bit wonky initially, but someone else took over our section and it was greatly improved.",

The food was great, we skipped the oysters but the charcuterie board was tastey with lots of different bits, loved the pickled cauliflower! Then we ordered pizza and carbonara from the menu. We would definitely return and think it would be better with more people so you could try more pizzas having slices of each as after 2 we were stuffed!
