The food was so good that I highly recommend trying it. We love Rioja wine, and having it with our meal made the evening even more wonderful. We also ordered entrecote steak, and it was cooked just the way I like it. I usually have trouble with that, but not here. I forgot to take a photo of it because I immediately started eating :) The place has two floors, and both are really lovely. Just take whichever floor you’re given and enjoy it.",

Dishes were skillfully cooked and presented (halibut beautifully done, clearly butter-basted), pricing much fairer than many similar restaurants (including the wine - nothing's cheap now, but the options were appreciated and the Cotes du Rhone lovely), and all the staff were so friendly, polite and professional.
