If you're plus size, expect to feel very awkward trying to get in/out of your table or in the restaurant at all!!\nFlowers were pretty..... 🤷‍♀️\nFood was pretty and tasty... so credit to the chefs/cooks.

Service was alright, food was decent, and prices were fair – nothing to complain about really.\n\nWe mainly came here to try the famous Pink Latte – spoiler alert: there’s no actual coffee in it! But to be fair, it looks lovely and actually tastes quite nice too.\n\nWould I come here again just for this? Probably not. In this part of London there’s loads of choice, so to stand out, a place really needs to be something special… and this felt more like a one-time visit.\n\nWorth trying once, but not a must-return.",

Food was lovely, even if a little overly priced, and the pistachio ice cream latte was amazing.\nStaff were friendly, and a couple of issues did arise for us that they rectified very quickly.\nNow to the reason for the 3 stars. Albeit we went on a Saturday afternoon, we did book a table. Inside is tiny, and it appears to now just be a cash grab with how many people they try to squeeze in. I literally knocked elbows with the bookings either side of where I was sitting, and to get in and out I had to duck under some of the fake flowers to get to my seat.\nA review of how many people are sag may be needed, as the atmosphere really let the experience down.",
