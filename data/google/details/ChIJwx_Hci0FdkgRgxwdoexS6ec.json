I’ve eaten at top places around the world, and what you served didn’t meet the mark. Instead of getting sassy or defensive, take it as a chance to improve. That’s how standards get better.\n\nI went to the kings road one on Saturday, the staff were extremely kind and welcoming, atmosphere was also nice. I ordered the pasta with truffle and honestly it was extremely salty and i couldn’t eat that. I thought maybe be it was the truffle so didn’t think too much of it. Then on Monday my pasta craving was still here as I was left very unsatisfied after Saturday’s experience. Decided to try the one on Hollywood road. It was Monday, less hectic on the kitchen staff so I assumed food will also be better!! Again super warm welcome from staff, we sat outside and it was really lovely. They served us a welcome bruschetta which was delicious. We then ordered Arancini, potato croquettes, potato al forno then the same pasta but this time without the truffle as I thought may be thats what made it too salty. Anyway my honest opinion about their Italian food is. Arancini was tasteless, potato al forno was very good, the pasta was extremely salty and the cheese they made the sauce with was most likely of very commercial quality. One of the worst Italian food experience i have ever encountered. They say “run by real italian mamas” like seriously if i had a real mama cooking italian food like this for me everyday, i would ask her to better rest and don’t cook at all.  Left the restaurant extremely disappointed, may be i didn’t choose the right dish, ill never know as we aren’t going back there ever.",

This month it was from Sardegna.\nThey offer 3 different set menus: pasta, main or pasta + main.\nWe chose the only-pasta one, it was more than enough, because includes starters (which by itself could be a complete meal), a lot of small delicious dishes, the outstanding one being the semolina and cheese with honey, and it was incredible, it is a cream that you can eat with bread, absolutely delicious! First time in many years I'm surprised with something's flavour and texture, and I do eat many different foods from everywhere.\nBy the time we got to the pasta dish, we were almost full, but still I made space for my pistacchio pesto pasta with guanciale, which was delicious.\nThe rest and dessert we took it home.\nService was ok but maybe a bit distant, except for la mamma who came to our table to talk a bit and brought us some bruschetta, courtesy of the house.\nDelicious and abundant food, I don't think you can get a more Italian place in London than this.",

      "text": "Thank-you to all at La Mia Mamma for an incredible dining experience and taste of Sardina. The food and atmosphere were amazing, even if we overestimated our stomach's capacities! We went for set menu of the the pasta + main each (4 people in our party). This is not for the faint of heart. I'd definitely recommend this beautiful Italian but perhaps think about just how much food you're likely to consume. The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. Think they realised that we couldn't continue eating and offered to pack it up for us to take away. The starters came out as they were ready, then we had a short break between the next two courses of pastas and our mains. The only feedback I could suggest is perhaps to talk through the set menu options to gauge how hungry or how much people can potentially eat before they order, as upon reflection we'd have ordered according to our capabilities as to not overload or feel bad in not being able to eat what we'd ordered. Mama Flore and the rest of the team were extremely friendly and accommodating. The way they celebrate birthdays &/or other celebrations was amazing and definitely added to our evening. We would highly recommend as not only was the food a taste sensation but also the atmosphere and of course the wonderful staff. Thank-you again!",
