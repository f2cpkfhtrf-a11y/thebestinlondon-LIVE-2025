      "text": "A different Italian!\nMy husband booked this place for my birthday dinner. He kept it as a surprise. The restaurant is within few metres of Canary Wharf tube station.\nUpon arrival we received a warm welcome. I received a birthday card signed by the squad of the restaurant. That was quite unique. I liked it!\nThe interior is impressive, nice decor and the lights - all give it a posh look.\nFor starter we ordered normal bread and garlic bread. With the first bite of each, I felt like it's completely different than any of them I have ever tasted. It was so good!\nFor the mains, my first choice was not available, hence I went with the sea bass option \"Branzino in Guazzetto\". I was sceptical with the thought of tomato sauce being too tangy. When it arrived and I took the first taste, I felt like I have never tasted a sauce like that before. It was tastebud-awakening! So delicious!\nMy husband had the pizza \"Some Like It Hot\", that was quite different tasting as well. It was slightly on hot side as it says.\nThey don't have a kids menu but we went with the recommended one \"Spaghettoni al Ragù di Agnellowhich\". It was perfect for the little one.\nFor the dessert we went for Creme Brulee, that came with a candle on top 😊\nThe service was superb throughout.\nAltogether it was an amazing dining experience and a perfect birthday meal! Thank you!",

The portion sizes were just right and generous. Every dish was prepared with care and beautifully presented.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was cozy and friendly, perfect for enjoying a nice meal. I will definitely come back again and recommend this place to anyone who loves real Italian food.",
