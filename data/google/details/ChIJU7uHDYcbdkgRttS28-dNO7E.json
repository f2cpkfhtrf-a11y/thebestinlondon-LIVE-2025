How is that even possible? Every course carried a subtle heat, something you rarely see in fine dining, and honestly, more restaurants should take note.\n\nThe drinks were just as impressive, each beautifully crafted with West African influences from Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Côte d’Ivoire. Sitting at the counter seats gave us the best view of the action, watching the chefs work with such care and precision. The staff were also incredibly friendly, explaining each dish in detail and sharing the stories behind them. The warmth and love from the whole team was truly felt throughout the experience.\n\nMy favourite dishes were the Jollof, squid abunuabunu, and monkfish egusi, all absolute standouts. It was such a joy to experience the flavours of West Africa, especially since it’s a cuisine we rarely get to enjoy back home in Sydney. Truly exceptional from start to finish. 👏🔥",

We enjoyed a 10-course tasting menu inspired by West African cuisine, and as a Nigerian, it was truly heartwarming to see so many familiar dishes beautifully reimagined.\n\nThe standout dish for me was the MoiMoi with mackerel and black eye bean sauce – perfectly balanced and packed with flavour. We were seated near the counter, which gave us a great view of the chefs in action and added an intimate touch to the evening.\n\nA special highlight was chatting with the head chef after the service, who gave us more insight into the menu and the inspiration behind the dishes.\n\nI’d also like to give a big thank you to Raheem, our waiter, whose professionalism, knowledge, and thoughtful commentary on each course made the experience even more memorable.\n\nHighly recommend Akoko for a special occasion – it’s a true celebration of West African flavours done with elegance and creativity.",

From the hand washing ceremony to the final dessert you will be transported to another culture and eat food you've likely never tasted before. You are presented with a menu when you sit down that describes the multiple courses you will receive. Mine offered an additional caviar dish for a supplement that I accepted since... Why not? The servers present each dish with an explanation of the ingredients and how best to eat it. Each server was incredible. I sat solo at the counter watching the chefs prepare the dishes. Each dish was unique and hard to even pick a favorite but there wasn't anything I wouldn't love to eat again. It's pricey for sure but you get your money's worth.",

Good mix of fish and meats and the smaller portion sizes is made up for the large number or portions.\n\nThe desserts were some of the best dishes I’ve had anywhere - we loved the Chin Chin and Black Sesame Fudge.\n\nWould recommend for those who want to experience some more refined flavours of Nigerian / West African cuisine.\n\nPairing menu with cocktails would be a nice touch for those that aren’t into the wines as much.",
