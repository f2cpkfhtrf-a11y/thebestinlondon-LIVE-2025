They greeted us with warm birthday wishes. A special thanks to Aneshwar, who went out of his way to accommodate our vegetarian preferences by modifying the weekday lunch set menu—it made the experience feel personal and inclusive. Call out to Preeta too for being extremely courteous through the meal. We were given fresh Plates & cutlery after every course, which added to the experience, since we didn’t mix dishes.\n\nFood: The set menu was generous and filling, with a refined twist on Indian classics. Standouts included the aubergine vathakal, kofta, broccoli in tandoor and the unforgettable desserts—payesh and kheer, which were beautifully balanced and full of flavour.\n\nDrinks: We’ve heard great things about their wine pairings, which are apparently excellent. Sadly, we didn’t get to try them this time—but definitely something to come back for.\n\nThe only slight downside was the Belu water being the only option at £3.50pp. It would be nice to have tap water offered as well.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful meal, exceptional service, and a warm, celebratory atmosphere. Highly recommended—especially for special occasions!",

I had the summer tasting menu that’s available for lunch and early dinner, and it was the best Indian food I’ve ever had.\n\nI ordered the quail appetizer, salmon appetizer, and eggplant curry main - all were outstanding and delicately spiced, with so many layers of flavor and textures. The mango cheesecake dessert was a wonderful end. I also felt welcomed as a solo diner which was appreciated.",

We selected five courses thinking they would be small like other tasting menus we have experienced, but the portions were very generous. We ended up taking some home with us. The shrimp and squid starter and salmon were our favorite dishes but everything we tried was delicious. We went for my birthday and they brought out a candle to make it special. It was a delicious and memorable experience and we highly recommend this restaurant.",

Very well deserved Michelin star ⭐\n\nBeautiful restaurant in a historic building with great interior design. Creative cocktails 🍹\n\nFor the starters, the Koliwala prawns and squid were outstanding. The beef curry with the fermented rice pancake was the star of the show as my husband’s main, but for me the grilled salmon is a dish I’ll be dreaming of for a long time. I never had such well cooked salmon and the curry leaf marinade was perfect.\n\nFriendly and professional staff who answered our questions about the food and helped us chose. Nice touch with a slice of birthday cake at the end of the meal 🍰",
