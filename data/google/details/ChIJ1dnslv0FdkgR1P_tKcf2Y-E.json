The food was amazing especially the halloumi, confit potato latkes, baba ganoush, lafa flatbreads. The service was very good and our waitress was super friendly and explained what some of the dishes were. Although on the slightly high price range, this place serves fresh quality food. The atmosphere between 12pm and 3pm was very buzzing and lively. Clearly a popular place for a reason. Will definitely be back and recommend to friends.",

Let this speak VOLUMES about this spot — it’s my very favourite restaurant in LDN and I’m not even veggie/vegan! 🤯🤯🤯\n\nBubala is giving organic/healthy meets sexy/sultry and I am positively OBSESSED! ❤️‍🔥\n\n• LOCATION:📍Soho (they also have locations in King’s Cross and their OG spot in Spitalfields!)\n\n• DISH OF THE DAY: without a single doubt the baba ganoush - we were salivating over the rich depth of flavour 🤤 Special mention also has to be made for the smacked cucumbers - wow! 🥒\n\n• FLAVOUR: 12/10 - foodie witchcraft. Outstanding flavours! Creative, unique, moreish x1000 🔥\n\n• PRESENTATION: 10/10 - beautiful, and authentic feeling! Perfect for sharing\n\n• VALUE FOR MONEY: the set/tasting menu can feel a little pricey but if there are just 2 of you I think it’s worth it. For £33/pp for 5 of us, including wine, we were stoked (and very full!)\n\n• SERVICE: 8.5/10 - our waitress was very sweet! Food came at the perfect pace\n\n• VIBES: 8.5/10 - it’s moody and earthy which feels so on-brand! Both their Spitalfields and Soho locations do feel a bit cramped but that’s just London buildings for ya!\n\n• GOOGLE RATING: 4.6 - could even see this being higher 👀\n\n• BEST FOR: Middle Eastern food, sharing plates, veggies/vegans, flavour-packed dishes\n\n• WOULD I RECOMMEND IT TO A FOODIE FRIEND? Legit my fave foodie spot in London 🫳 🎤\n\nIf you are looking for DAILY videos on the best places to EAT, SEE and VISIT as a foodie then come find me on socials @octavia.overseas! 💁🏼‍♀️🇪🇸💫\n\n🚨 You can also download my Foodie Google Maps Guides totally for FREE from my IG/TikTok bio! 🗺️",

I wish I had made a note of the 3 people who served us, I think one was the manager. They were so helpful about the 'Bubala knows best' set menu and accommodating with a vegan and vegetarian mix for the 3 of us.\n\nThe food is incredibly tasty. We all loved it. Each dish tastes different and I couldn't choose a favourite. The mango and chilli drink is delicious.\n\nI can't wait to go back and a cookbook is coming out in October!",

      "text": "We had a really high expectation of this place given the raving reviews and lots of recommendations, especially with the vegan/veg options. We were able to get a seat without booking on a busy weekend which we were grateful. I must start from the service and need to provide the explanation of it first before I go into the food review. We were seated downstairs and there were initially two servers but later became one and sat behind the bar area at the back. The service felt very generic with very little personality and felt as though the person was not very happy or focused. They took the order and we ordered quite a few dishes (which became apparent later on) and there was no indication from the server that we ordered way too much. There was a missing tea which took a quite long time to be rectified. There were a few moments in the service where it was hard to get any attention given they were working facing behind. Later on another table asked for service charge taken out due to lack of service, and they have become quite upset and the rest of the evening felt a little off (and hence atmosphere also felt a little off). The food was great, throughout except for the natural red wine which tasted like a vinegar - really bad option. The sad point is that because of the amount of food we ordered, it became too much to enjoy towards the end and had the server did a better job suggesting the right amount we would have enjoyed the evening more.",

      "text": "I  visited Bubala Soho over a weekend in June, and it was a fantastic dining experience. We chose the restaurant for its strong selection of vegetarian and vegan options, and it definitely delivered.\n\nAlthough we arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation, we were promptly seated without any issues. The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, taking the time to explain the concept and menu, which we really appreciated.\n\nWe opted for the vegan set menu, and by the end of the meal, we were more than happy with our choice. Every dish was beautifully presented and full of flavour. Highlights for me were the babaganoush, which was smoky and rich, and the grilled oyster mushrooms, which had an amazing texture and depth of taste.\n\nOverall, a warm and satisfying experience—perfect for anyone looking to enjoy creative, plant-based Middle Eastern dishes in the heart of Soho. Highly recommended!",
