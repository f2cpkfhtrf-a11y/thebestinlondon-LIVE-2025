The mains took an approximate additional thirty minutes to arrive afterwards. The chicken breast was overcooked and dry and for 28£ it should have had more substance. The squash ravioli had the strangest flavor of sweetness and were absolutely not enjoyable to eat. Service charge included in the bill. Will definitely not be back or recommend this place for an enjoyable food experience.",

The pear, kale & squash salad was delicious, the whipped butter that came with the rolled out soda bread was so soft and airy, and of course the sea bream was absolutely divine, we literally ate in silence and didn't even spare time to snag a photo because it was THAT good. The mocktails and the jaffa dessert were also amazing! This’ll be on my top recommended!",

She catered and assisted EVERY person on the table and we was quiet a handful but she managed it very well from the specific orders to cake preference which the pricing was absurd but she made me feel at ease paying it all with delight that’s how great she is. She is an asset to the team, will actually be telling all my peers to Visit this restaurant just because of STEFANIA, thank you for making our Sunday a great a service! She deserves a raise",

You could tell they just get it without any effort and the quality of oranges were not very good and quantity was very very small. It was smaller than a glass of water. The other thing that was disappointing was that one of the cappuccinos we ordered was already split it from the kitchen and then the waiter served it for us and he spilled a bit on the the girl and he didn’t even apologise and the girl was a bit shy to tell him but it looked like it was badly made and under the mug you could see that the coffee was spilled from the kitchen and there was not even an apology.\n\nAt the end of our stay a waitress came to us and said are you guys ordering any drinks or should I get the bill which I found a bit rude because we were enjoying our time and we  actually got a lot of plates and coffees, so I didn’t find the service very good however the other staff were really nice. They did replace the orange juice with a cappuccino.\n\nOverall, I wouldn’t come again to that place because the food was overpriced and some of the plates weren’t the best. One of the plates had bacon and the bacon was very overcooked and stiff and the toasts are the muffins were a bit too toasted.\n\nBut I would say it’s a nice place for a coffee meet up but only for coffee",
