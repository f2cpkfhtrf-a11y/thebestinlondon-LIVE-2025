My partner wanted to treat me to a meal.\n\nThe starter was disappointing: corn ribs that were basically just slices of corn on the cob dumped in a bland sauce. Quite poor. My partner had the dumplings, which were nice—I wish I’d ordered those instead.\n\nThe main was better: a Korean chick+n burger that tasted surprisingly like real chicken. The fries were nothing special. My partner had the curry, which was okay but not earth-shattering.\n\nFor dessert, my partner had the cheesecake, which was nothing to shout about. At that point, I didn’t want anything else.\n\nBut what really ruined the experience was the service—it was awful, to the point of being non-existent.\n\nMost customers had to get up to ask for the bill or order extra drinks during their meal. It took ages for plates to be cleared between courses or for drinks to arrive.\n\nThey weren’t short-staffed, but the team—including the manager—seemed completely oblivious to the fact they had customers. They stood around chatting and walked past people clearly trying to get their attention to order, get drinks, or pay.\n\nIf this is how the chain is run, then this particular branch is definitely the weak link.\n\nI even them leave a take on the counter getting for 10minutes before the courier turned to take it. So you know that gonna cold.\n\nI cannot see me and my partner returning.\n\nAnd it was overpriced.\nDate of experience: 10 August 2025",
