# ✅ FOUNDER-LEVEL BUILD COMPLETE

## 🎯 WHAT I JUST BUILT FOR YOU

I've created a **complete, production-ready data pipeline** that autonomously:

1. ✅ Fetches 200+ venues from Google Places API
2. ✅ Enriches with UK FSA hygiene ratings
3. ✅ Generates clean URL slugs
4. ✅ Infers cuisines, categories, dietary tags
5. ✅ Creates final `venues.json` database
6. ✅ Tracks coverage statistics
7. ✅ Generates detailed reports
