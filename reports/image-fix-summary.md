# Image Fix Summary

## Root Cause Analysis

The image loading issues were caused by:

1. **Google Places API 403 Errors**: The API key may have exceeded quota or billing limits
2. **Unsplash 404 Errors**: Some image URLs were pointing to non-existent images
3. **Next.js Image Component Issues**: The `LazyImage` component was using `next/image` with `placeholder='blur'` but missing `blurDataURL`

## Solution Implemented

1. **Created `ImageWithFallback` Component**:
   - Handles image loading errors gracefully
   - Falls back to a placeholder image when the primary image fails to load
   - Uses Next.js `Image` component with proper error handling

2. **Updated All Pages**:
   - Homepage (`pages/index.js`)
   - Halal page (`pages/best-halal-restaurants-london.js`)
   - Restaurant detail page (`pages/restaurant/[slug].js`)

3. **Image URL Versioning**:
   - Added version parameter to image URLs to bust cache
   - Format: `?v=1760780596887`

## Files Modified

1. `components/ImageWithFallback.js` - New component for handling image fallbacks
2. `pages/index.js` - Updated to use ImageWithFallback
3. `pages/best-halal-restaurants-london.js` - Updated to use ImageWithFallback
4. `pages/restaurant/[slug].js` - Updated to use ImageWithFallback

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the changes to production
2. Monitor image loading in production
3. Consider implementing a more robust image CDN solution
4. Review Google Places API usage and billing

## Testing

- All linter errors have been resolved
- Components are properly importing ImageWithFallback
- Image URLs include version parameters for cache busting
