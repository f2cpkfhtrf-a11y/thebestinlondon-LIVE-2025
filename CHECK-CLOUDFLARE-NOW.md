## 🎯 CHECK CLOUDFLARE PAGES DEPLOYMENT

### Step 1: Navigate to Workers & Pages
In the Cloudflare dashboard:
1. Click **"Workers & Pages"** in the left sidebar
2. Look for project: **"thebestinlondon"** or similar

### Step 2: Check Deployment Status
You should see one of these:

#### ✅ **If you see "Success" (green checkmark):**
- Click on the project
- Find the **"Production"** deployment
- Click **"View"** to see your live site
- Copy the URL (usually: `thebestinlondon.pages.dev`)

#### ⚠️ **If you see "Failed" (red X):**
- Click on the failed deployment
- Check the **build logs**
- Look for error messages
- Share the error with me so I can fix it

#### 🔄 **If you see "In Progress" (spinning):**
- Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete
- Refresh the page
- Check again

#### ❌ **If you DON'T see "thebestinlondon" project:**
- Cloudflare Pages is NOT connected yet

## 🔗 IS CLOUDFLARE CONNECTED TO GITHUB?

### Quick Test:
1. Go to: **Workers & Pages** → **Create Application** → **Pages** → **Connect to Git**

## 🌐 WHAT'S YOUR DOMAIN POINTING TO?

### Check thebestinlondon.co.uk:
1. In Cloudflare dashboard, click **"Websites"** (or "Domains")

3. Check **DNS records**

### Should see:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: thebestinlondon.co.uk (or @)
