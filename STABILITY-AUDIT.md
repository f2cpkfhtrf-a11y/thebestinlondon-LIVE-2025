# 🛡️ STABILITY AUDIT & PREVENTION PLAN

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Project:** BestOfLondon  
**Critical:** Read this to prevent data loss and crashes

---

## 🔴 ISSUE THAT JUST HAPPENED

### **What Went Wrong**
Script tried to use `require()` on a file using ES6 `export` syntax.

### **Why It Happened**
- fsaClient.js used ES6 module syntax (`export`)
- Repair script used CommonJS (`require`)
- No validation caught the mismatch

### **Root Cause**
Mixed module systems across codebase with no consistency checks.

---

## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIXES APPLIED

### 1. **Stability Layer Created** (`scripts/stability-layer.js`)
- ✅ Auto-backup before any data mutation
- ✅ Validation after changes
- ✅ Automatic rollback on failure
- ✅ Keeps last 10 backups

### 2. **Safe FSA Repair** (`scripts/safe-fsa-repair.js`)
- ✅ Uses stability layer
- ✅ No direct data mutation
- ✅ Rollback on error
- ✅ Inline FSA logic (no module dependencies)

### 3. **Module System Fixed**
- ✅ fsaClient.js converted to CommonJS
- ✅ All scripts now use consistent require()

---

## 🔍 COMPREHENSIVE STABILITY AUDIT

### ✅ **What's Safe Now**

1. **Data Pipeline Scripts**
   - ✅ `fetchPlaces.js` - Independent, no dependencies
   - ✅ `fetchPlaceDetails.js` - Independent
   - ✅ `buildVenues.js` - Has inline FSA logic, safe
   - ✅ `run-data-pipeline.js` - Orchestrator, safe

2. **Utilities**
   - ✅ `fsaClient.js` - Fixed to CommonJS
   - ⚠️  `venueEnhancer.js` - Check if used anywhere

3. **Safety Systems**
   - ✅ `stability-layer.js` - New, provides backup/restore
   - ✅ `safe-fsa-repair.js` - New, safe FSA updates

---

### ⚠️ **Potential Issues & Solutions**

#### **ISSUE 1: No Automated Backups**
**Risk:** Data loss if script crashes mid-execution  
**Impact:** HIGH  
**Solution:** ✅ FIXED - stability-layer.js now handles this

**Test it:**
```bash
node scripts/stability-layer.js validate
node scripts/stability-layer.js backup
```

---

#### **ISSUE 2: Google API Rate Limits**
**Risk:** Pipeline fails if >1000 requests/month  
**Impact:** MEDIUM (work blocker until quota resets)  
**Current Status:** Using ~250 requests per full run  

**Prevention:**
```bash
# Check quota usage before running pipeline
# https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard

# If near limit, reduce queries in fetchPlaces.js:
# Change: limit: 30
# To: limit: 15
```

**Solution if exceeded:**
- Wait until month resets (1st of month)
- Or enable billing (increases to 100k/month)

---

#### **ISSUE 3: FSA API Unreliability**
**Risk:** FSA lookups fail randomly  
**Impact:** LOW (expected behavior, 60-70% success rate)  
**Current Status:** Handled gracefully with fallbacks

**Expected behavior:**
- 30-40% of FSA lookups will fail
- International chains won't have FSA data
- This is NORMAL, not a bug

**No action needed** - scripts handle this.

---

#### **ISSUE 4: venues.json Corruption**
**Risk:** Malformed JSON breaks the entire site  
**Impact:** CRITICAL (site won't load)

**Prevention:** ✅ FIXED
- stability-layer.js validates structure
- Auto-rollback on corruption
- Keeps 10 backups

**Test it:**
```bash
node scripts/stability-layer.js validate
```

**If corrupted:**
```bash
node scripts/stability-layer.js restore
```

---

#### **ISSUE 5: Image URL Expiration**
**Risk:** Google Place Photos URLs may expire  
**Impact:** MEDIUM (photos stop loading)  
**Timeline:** URLs valid for ~1-2 years

**Prevention:**
- Re-run pipeline quarterly to refresh URLs
- Or migrate to Cloudinary (on roadmap)

**Current solution:**
Photos include attribution and are CDN-backed.

---

#### **ISSUE 6: Build Cache Issues**
**Risk:** Next.js may cache old venues.json  
**Impact:** MEDIUM (new data doesn't appear)

**Solution:**
```bash
# After any data update, clear cache:
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```

**Or use dev mode (auto-refreshes):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

#### **ISSUE 7: Environment Variables**
**Risk:** Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY breaks site  
**Impact:** CRITICAL

**Prevention:**
```bash
# Verify .env.local exists:
cat .env.local | grep NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY

# If missing, add:
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE" >> .env.local
```

**Never commit .env.local to git!**

---

#### **ISSUE 8: Deployment Failures**
**Risk:** Build succeeds locally but fails on Vercel  
**Impact:** HIGH (can't deploy)

**Common causes:**
- Missing environment variables on Vercel
- Build timeout (>45 minutes)
- Out of memory

**Prevention:**
1. Add env vars to Vercel dashboard
2. Test build locally first: `npm run build`
3. Use Vercel CLI for deploy (not GUI)

---

#### **ISSUE 9: Duplicate Venues**
**Risk:** Same venue appears multiple times  
**Impact:** LOW (user experience issue)

**Current Status:** Deduped by place_id

**If duplicates appear:**
```bash
# Check for duplicates:
cat public/venues.json | jq '.venues | group_by(.place_id) | map(select(length > 1))'

# If found, clear cache and re-run:
rm -rf data/google/details/*
node scripts/run-data-pipeline.js
```

---

#### **ISSUE 10: Stale Data**
**Risk:** Venue info becomes outdated (ratings, hours, etc.)  
**Impact:** LOW (gradual degradation)  
**Timeline:** Data freshness ~3-6 months

**Prevention:**
Run monthly refresh:
```bash
node scripts/run-data-pipeline.js
```

Set up cron job (optional):
```bash
# Run 1st of every month at 3am
0 3 1 * * cd ~/Desktop/thebestinlondon && node scripts/run-data-pipeline.js
```

---

## 🚀 NEW SAFE WORKFLOW

node scripts/stability-layer.js validate
# Expected: ✅ Venues data is valid

# Test 2: Backup
node scripts/stability-layer.js backup
# Expected: ✅ Backup created

# Test 3: Safe FSA repair (this will run for real!)
node scripts/safe-fsa-repair.js
# Expected: Backup → Repair → Validate → Success

# Test 4: Check backups exist
ls -lh backups/
# Expected: List of timestamped backup files
```

---

## 📊 MONITORING COMMANDS

```bash
# Check data quality
node scripts/stability-layer.js validate

# View coverage stats
cat data/coverage.json

# Count venues
cat public/venues.json | grep -c '"place_id"'

# Check FSA coverage
cat public/venues.json | grep -o '"fsa_rating":[0-9]' | wc -l

# View latest backup
ls -lt backups/ | head -5

# Check file sizes
du -h public/venues.json
du -h data/coverage.json
```

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

Your site is stable when:

- ✅ `node scripts/stability-layer.js validate` passes
- ✅ At least 1 backup exists in `/backups`
- ✅ venues.json is 5-7 MB
- ✅ FSA coverage ≥60%
- ✅ `npm run build` succeeds
- ✅ Site loads at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ No console errors in browser

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS

**Stop and investigate if:**
