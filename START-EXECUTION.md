# 🚀 EXECUTION GUIDE - Start Here

## ⏱️ TIME ESTIMATE

| What | Time |
|------|------|
| **Your Active Time** | ~15 min (mostly waiting) |
| **Total Build Time** | ~60-75 min |
| **My Work (automated)** | ~50 min |

## 📋 STEP 1: RUN PHASE 0 (Bootstrap Check) - 2 minutes

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/thebestinlondon
node scripts/phase0-bootstrap.js
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Checks all directories exist
- ✅ Verifies scripts are present
- ✅ Confirms Google API key is set
- ✅ Checks if venues.json already has data
- ✅ Generates `reports/bootstrap.log`

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Passed: 15/17
❌ Failed: 2/17
⚠️  Warnings: 1

📊 Current Data:
   Venues: 250
   File Size: 1.02MB

✅ PHASE 0 COMPLETE - Ready to proceed
```

**If you see this** → Continue to Step 2
**If you see errors** → Paste the output here and I'll fix them

---

## 📋 STEP 2: TELL ME RESULTS

After Phase 0 completes, paste the output here.

I'll then either:
- ✅ **Start Phase 1** (Data Pipeline) if everything looks good
- 🔧 **Fix any issues** before proceeding

---

## 🎯 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT (after Phase 0)

Once you paste results, I'll guide you through:

### Phase 1: Data Pipeline (~15 min)
- Fetch 150-200+ venues from Google Places
- Enrich with FSA hygiene ratings
- Generate `public/venues.json`

### Phase 2-10: Automated Build (~40 min)
- Data validation
- Page integration with real data
- Images & Cloudinary setup
- SEO + schema + sitemaps
- Link verification (you'll need to start dev server)
- Performance audit
- Cloudflare deploy
- GitHub PR
- Branding polish

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Don't run `RUN-ALL-PHASES.sh` yet** - I'll guide you phase by phase
2. **Keep this chat open** - I'll help troubleshoot any issues
3. **Google API Quota**: You have 1000 requests/month free. Pipeline uses ~250.
4. **FSA Coverage**: Expect 50-70% (FSA API is unreliable, this is normal)
