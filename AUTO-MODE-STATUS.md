**Timestamp:** 2025-10-16 21:30 GMT  
**Branch:** main  
**Objective:** Get site LIVE with real data and working deployments

---

## ✅ COMPLETED ACTIONS

### 1. Diagnosed Root Issues
- ✅ Found venue station pages had correct inline components (no imports of Header/Footer/VenueCard)

- ✅ Verified API key present in `.env.local`
- ✅ Verified all data pipeline scripts exist

### 2. Committed Station Pages
- ✅ Committed both station page files: `pages/halal/near-stations/*.js`
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub main branch
- ✅ Message: "fix: station pages with inline components"

### 3. Started Data Pipeline
- ✅ Launched: `node scripts/run-data-pipeline.js`
- ⏳ **IN PROGRESS** (10-15 min runtime)
- Will generate:
  - `public/venues.json` (200+ venues)
  - `data/coverage.json` (stats)
  - Reports in `/reports/`

## 🔄 CURRENTLY RUNNING

**Data Pipeline Phases:**
1. Phase 1: Fetch place IDs from Google Places API (2-3 min)
2. Phase 2: Fetch full details for each venue (5-7 min)  
3. Phase 3: Merge with FSA hygiene data + build venues.json (3-5 min)

**Expected Completion:** ~21:45 GMT

**Monitoring:** Terminal tab running, output logged to `pipeline-run.log`
