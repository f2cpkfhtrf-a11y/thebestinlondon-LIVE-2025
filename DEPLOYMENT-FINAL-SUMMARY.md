### **Option A: Vercel Auto-Deployed** ✅
If webhook working:
1. Wait 3-5 minutes for deployment
2. Test: https://thebestinlondon.co.uk/halal-near-stations-simple
3. If works → SUCCESS!

### **Option B: Manual Deploy Needed** 🔧
If no auto-deploy:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
3. Uncheck "Use existing Build Cache"
4. Wait 3-5 minutes
5. Test URLs

## 📝 WHAT'S STILL TODO (Optional)

### **Short Term** (If You Want)
1. Connect simplified station page to real venue data
2. Add dynamic routes for individual stations
3. Add filtering by cuisine/rating

### **Medium Term** (Future)
1. Expand to more stations (26 total)
2. Add distance calculations
3. Add "near me" functionality

### **Not Urgent**
1. Delete `/archive/` folder (after 30 days)
2. Add Google Analytics
3. Performance optimizations

---

## 🛡️ SAFETY GUARANTEES

### **What Was Preserved** (100%)
✅ All code (pages, components, utils, styles)  
✅ All data (venues.json, sitemaps, reports)  
✅ All config (package.json, next.config.js, .env)  
✅ Git history (all commits intact)  

### **What Was Moved** (Recoverable)
📦 All junk files → `/archive/`  
- Can restore anytime  
- Can delete safely after 30 days  
- Zero risk  

### **What Was Deleted** (Nothing)
❌ NOTHING deleted  
- Everything archived  
- 100% reversible
