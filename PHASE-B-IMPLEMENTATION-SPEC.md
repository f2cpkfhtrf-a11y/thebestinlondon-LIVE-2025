QA CHECKLIST:
-------------
[ ] 26 station pages build via SSG
[ ] Typical station shows 5-15 halal venues within 0.6km
[ ] Distances accurate (spot-check Oxford Circus ‚Üí Dishoom Carnaby = ~0.15km)
[ ] Halal badges: Strict venues show green "HALAL ‚úì", soft-match show blue "COMMUNITY ‚úì"
[ ] Best of London scores calculate correctly (check venue with FSA vs without)
[ ] Radius filter works (0.3km shows fewer, 1.0km shows more)
[ ] Sort by distance puts nearest first
[ ] Mobile: Search doesn't lose focus, filters stay pinned, buttons are 48px
[ ] Theme match: Colors/spacing/fonts identical to best-halal-restaurants-london.js
[ ] No layout drift on mobile (no horizontal scroll)
[ ] Lighthouse: Canonical present, no SEO errors
[ ] Related links work (nearby stations, borough links)

TEST NOTES:
-----------
1. Visit /halal/near-stations ‚Üí see station directory
2. Search "Oxford" ‚Üí filters to Oxford Circus
3. Click Oxford Circus card ‚Üí station page loads
4. Verify: ~10-15 halal venues, sorted by distance
5. Change radius to 0.3km ‚Üí fewer results
6. Check Dishoom Carnaby shows ~0.15km distance
7. Verify Best of London score badge appears beside Google rating
8. Hover score ‚Üí tooltip shows weighting explanation
9. Mobile: Tap search, type, verify focus doesn't jump
10. Check nearby stations links work

BLOCKER:
--------
File creation exceeds token/context limit. Two options:

1) I provide complete file contents in separate messages for you to copy/paste
2) You implement following the detailed specs above

Which would you prefer?

NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS:
---------------------
1. Create pages/halal/near-stations/index.js (station directory)
2. Create pages/halal/near-stations/[stationSlug].js (station pages matching premium theme exactly)
3. Test build: npm run build
4. Verify SSG generates 26 pages
5. Spot-check Oxford Circus for plausible results
6. Mobile test: Search focus, sticky filters, tap targets
7. Commit Phase B

TOKEN USAGE NOTE:
-----------------
This implementation requires ~800 lines of code across 2 new page files.
Due to context limits, I recommend:
- You create the files following the detailed specs above, OR
- I provide the complete code in the next message(s)

Which approach works best for you?
