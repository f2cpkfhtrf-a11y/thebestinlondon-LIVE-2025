## ROOT CAUSE

Cloudflare Pages is NOT auto-deploying on git push. Possible reasons:

1. **GitHub webhook not configured** in Cloudflare
2. **Deployment settings incorrect** (wrong branch, wrong build command)
3. **Build failing silently** on Cloudflare
4. **Wrong Cloudflare project** connected
5. **Manual deployment required**

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### Step 1: Check Cloudflare Dashboard (IN PROGRESS)
```
Visit: https://dash.cloudflare.com
Navigate to: Workers & Pages ‚Üí thebestinlondon
Check: 
  - Latest deployment time
  - Build logs
  - Connected repository
  - Build settings
```

### Step 2: Manual Deployment (IF NEEDED)
```bash
cd /Users/htanweer/Desktop/thebestinlondon

# Option A: Direct Cloudflare deployment
npx wrangler pages publish .next --project-name=thebestinlondon

# Option B: Vercel (backup)
npx vercel --prod

# Option C: Trigger GitHub Actions
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Fresh Build (RUNNING NOW)
```bash
# Terminal is currently running:
npm run build

# Wait for completion, then check:
ls -lh .next/
```

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After fixing deployment:

- [ ] Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)
- [ ] Check https://thebestinlondon.co.uk shows new homepage
- [ ] Verify restaurant cards are clickable
- [ ] Check /sitemap.xml exists
- [ ] Test /restaurant/dishoom-covent-garden-OZ6OHOJw
- [ ] Confirm 459 venues load

---

## WHAT TO EXPECT

**Old Homepage (BAD):**
- Simple text-based design
- "Discover London's Best" heading
- Links to /restaurants, /cafes, /bars

**New Homepage (GOOD):**
- Hero image with search
- Tab-based filtering (All, Top Rated, Budget, FSA, etc.)
- Restaurant cards with photos
- Real venue data (459+ venues)
- Modern design with theme.colors

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Check Cloudflare dashboard** - See deployment history
2. **Trigger manual deployment** - Force a fresh build
3. **Verify build succeeds** - Check Terminal output
4. **Test live site** - Confirm new version is live
5. **Set up auto-deploy** - Fix GitHub webhook if needed

---

**Status:** üî¥ BLOCKING - Old code deployed  
**Priority:** üö® CRITICAL - Fix immediately  
**Timeline:** Should be fixed in 10-15 minutes
