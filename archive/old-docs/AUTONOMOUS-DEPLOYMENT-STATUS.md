## 🔑 CRITICAL INFORMATION

### Environment Variables
The script uses your local `.env.local` file during build:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY=AIzaSyCOYUi9A598QJGWk7hZK0_6_ojdvSNhZhw
```

This gets baked into the build, so restaurants will load!

### Cloudflare Account
```
Account ID: 9947c88df88e197e6588e6f5fdb734a6
Email: Hassant05@hotmail.com
Domain: thebestinlondon.co.uk (ready to connect)
```

### Deployment Method
```
Method: Wrangler Direct Upload
Advantage: No UI needed, fully automated
Output: https://thebestinlondon.pages.dev
```

**No action needed** - just approve when browser opens!
