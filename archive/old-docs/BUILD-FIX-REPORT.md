# ✅ BUILD FIX COMPLETE

## 🚨 What Was Wrong
Vercel build was failing with:
```
TypeError: e.dietary_tags.includes is not a function
```

**Root cause**: 
- `dietary_tags` is an OBJECT: `{halal: true, vegan: false}`
- Code was calling `.includes('halal')` (array method)
- `.includes()` doesn't work on objects!

## ✅ The Fix
Changed ALL instances in `index.js` and `[cuisine].js`:

**Before (WRONG):**
```javascript
v.dietary_tags && v.dietary_tags.includes('halal')
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```javascript
v.dietary_tags?.halal === true
```

## 📦 What Was Committed
**Commit**: `9a9cee2` - "fix: dietary_tags is object not array"
**Files fixed**:
- ✅ `pages/index.js` (8 changes)
- ✅ `pages/[cuisine].js` (already fixed earlier)
- ✅ `pages/restaurant/[slug].js` (reviews section added)

**Previous commit**: `f669c5e` - "feat: add reviews section"

## ⏰ Timeline
- **00:52**: Vercel build failed (dietary_tags error)
- **00:56**: Diagnosed: index.js changes not committed

## 🔧 Technical Details
**What dietary_tags actually looks like in data:**
```json
{
  "dietary_tags": {
    "halal": true,
    "vegan": false,
    "vegetarian": false,
    "gluten_free": true
  }
}
```

**Why the fix works:**
- `dietary_tags.halal` → Accesses object property ✅
- `dietary_tags.includes('halal')` → Tries array method on object ❌

**Files that needed fixing:**
- `pages/index.js` → 8 instances (filter logic + tab counts)
- `pages/[cuisine].js` → Already fixed earlier
- All other pages → Don't use dietary filters
