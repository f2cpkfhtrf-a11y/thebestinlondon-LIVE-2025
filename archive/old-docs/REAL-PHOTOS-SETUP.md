# üéØ GET REAL RESTAURANT PHOTOS - Setup Guide

## The Problem
You're right - **images MUST match the actual restaurants!** Generic Unsplash photos don't work.

## The Solution
Use **Google Places API Photos** - the REAL photos from Google Maps/Search.

## üöÄ STEP 1: Get Google Places API Key (5 minutes)

### 1. Go to Google Cloud Console

- Click "New Project"
- Name it: "TheBestInLondon"
- Click "Create"

### 3. Enable Places API
- In the search bar, type "Places API"
- Click on "Places API"
- Click "Enable"

### 4. Create API Key
- Go to "Credentials" in the left sidebar
- Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "API Key"
- Copy the API key that appears
- Click "Restrict Key" (important for security!)

### 5. Restrict the Key
In the API key settings:

**Application restrictions:**
- Select "HTTP referrers (websites)"
- Add these referrers:
  ```
  http://localhost:3001/*
  https://thebestinlondon.co.uk/*
  https://*.vercel.app/*
  ```

**API restrictions:**

### Open your .env.local file:
```bash
nano /Users/htanweer/Desktop/thebestinlondon/.env.local
```

### Add your API key:

# Google Places API Key (for restaurant images)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY=AIzaSyC_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE

# DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE TO GIT!
```

### Save and close (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)

---

## üîÑ STEP 3: Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then start it again:

npm run dev
```

## ‚úÖ STEP 4: Verify It Works

Visit any page:
- http://localhost:3001/vegan-restaurants-london
- http://localhost:3001/halal-restaurants-london

**You should now see:**
- ‚úÖ REAL restaurant photos from Google Maps
- ‚úÖ Actual images of the venues
- ‚úÖ Photos match the restaurants perfectly!

## üí∞ Pricing Info

Google Places API is **FREE** for your usage:

- Your site will use ~10-50 requests per page load
- With 1,000 visitors/month = ~50,000 requests = **FREE**
- You won't pay anything unless you get massive traffic

### Enable Billing (Required, but won't charge you):
- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
- Link a payment method (required by Google)
- Set a budget alert at $5 to be safe
- You won't be charged for normal usage

## üé® How It Works

### With API Key (REAL PHOTOS):
```
venue.photos[0].photo_reference 
    ‚Üì
Google Places API
    ‚Üì
REAL restaurant image from Google Maps
    ‚Üì
Displayed on your site ‚úÖ
```

### Without API Key (FALLBACK):
```
venue.category = "vegan"
    ‚Üì
Category-specific Unsplash image
    ‚Üì
Professional food photo (vegan-themed)
    ‚Üì
Better than nothing, but NOT the actual restaurant
```

## üî• Benefits of Real Photos

1. **Trust** - Users see the ACTUAL restaurant
2. **SEO** - Google rewards accurate images
3. **Conversions** - Real photos = more clicks
4. **Professional** - Like TripAdvisor, Google Maps, etc.
5. **Automatic** - Photos update when restaurant updates theirs

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Images still not showing"
- Make sure API key starts with `AIzaSy`
- Check you enabled "Places API" (not "Places SDK")
- Verify .env.local has `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
- Restart dev server after adding key

### "API key not valid" error
- Check API restrictions allow your domain
- Make sure HTTP referrers include localhost:3001
- Wait 1-2 minutes for restrictions to take effect

### "Billing must be enabled"
- Go to: console.cloud.google.com/billing
- Add payment method
- Don't worry - you won't be charged for normal usage
