# üö® DEPLOYMENT FIX REQUIRED

## THE PROBLEM:
`public/venues.json` is NOT being found by Vercel during build!

## WHY:
When you uploaded files via GitHub web interface, the folder structure wasn't preserved correctly.

## THE FIX - Do THIS NOW:

### Option 1: Upload via GitHub Web (CORRECT WAY)

1. Go to: https://github.com/f2cpkfhrf-a11y/thebestinlondon-LIVE-2025

2. Navigate INTO the `public` folder:
   - Click on "public" folder
   
3. Upload venues.json:
   - Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Upload files"
   - Drag `/Users/htanweer/Desktop/thebestinlondon/public/venues.json`
   - Commit: "Add venues.json to public folder"

### Option 2: Use Git Command Line (IF GITHUB WEB DOESN'T WORK)

```bash
cd /Users/htanweer/Desktop/thebestinlondon
git add public/venues.json
git commit -m "Add venues data file to public folder"
git push origin main
```

## VERIFY IT WORKED:

After uploading, check this URL exists:
https://github.com/f2cpkfhrf-a11y/thebestinlondon-LIVE-2025/blob/main/public/venues.json

If you see the file content, SUCCESS!

Then wait 3 minutes for Vercel to auto-deploy.

## CURRENT STATUS:
- Code: ‚úÖ On GitHub
- Files: ‚úÖ On GitHub  
- venues.json: ‚ùå MISSING or in WRONG location
- Result: 0 restaurants showing

---

**PRIORITY:** Fix this ASAP - venues.json must be in the `public/` folder!
